tactic: "Command and Control"
technique_id: "T1572"
technique_name: "Protocol Tunneling"
description: >
  Detect adversaries using protocol tunneling to evade detection and communicate with C2 servers by encapsulating protocols within other protocols.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Network Traffic for Encapsulation Patterns"
    description: >
      Analyze network traffic for indications of tunneling such as unusual protocol encapsulation or traffic anomalies.
    checklist:
      - "Are there packets with protocol headers inside unexpected transport protocols?"
      - "Is there a pattern of traffic that deviates from normal baselines?"
      - "Are there tunnels over non-standard ports or protocols?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic captures"
      - "IDS/IPS logs"
      - "Network flow data"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Known Tunneling Tools or Protocols"
    description: >
      Detect traffic associated with known tunneling tools (e.g., DNS tunneling tools, VPN-like software).
    checklist:
      - "Are there signatures matching known tunneling software?"
      - "Is there evidence of encapsulated DNS, ICMP, or HTTP traffic?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network IDS/IPS signatures"
      - "Threat intelligence"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Tunneling Activity with Endpoint and User Behavior"
    description: >
      Check for suspicious endpoint processes or user activity concurrent with tunneling detection.
    checklist:
      - "Are endpoints running suspicious or unauthorized tunneling tools?"
      - "Is tunneling activity linked to abnormal user logins or privilege escalation?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection and response (EDR)"
      - "User activity logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal protocol use."
      - "Medium: Suspicious tunneling patterns."
      - "High: Confirmed protocol tunneling C2."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: IOC or signature match."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious encapsulated protocols"
  - "Known tunneling tool signatures"
  - "Unusual port/protocol combinations"
