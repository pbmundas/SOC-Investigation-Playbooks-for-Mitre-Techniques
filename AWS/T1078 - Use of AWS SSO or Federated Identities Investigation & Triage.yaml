playbook_name: "T1078 - Use of AWS SSO or Federated Identities: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1078"
technique_name: "Valid Accounts"
description: >
  Detect and investigate the use of AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) or federated identity providers (IdPs) to access AWS resources, which attackers may abuse for persistence or lateral movement.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor AWS SSO Login and Role Assumption Events"
    description: >
      Review AWS CloudTrail logs for console login events and role assumptions initiated via AWS SSO.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected or unusual AWS SSO login events?"
      - "Is SSO access occurring outside normal business hours or from unfamiliar IP addresses or geolocations?"
      - "Are there failed or denied login attempts indicating brute force or reconnaissance?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail (ConsoleLogin events)"
      - "AWS SSO Audit Logs"
      - "Identity Provider (IdP) logs (e.g., Okta, Azure AD)"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Federation via SAML or Web Identity Providers"
    description: >
      Identify AssumeRoleWithSAML or AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity events which indicate federated access to AWS roles.
    checklist:
      - "Are federated roles assumed by unexpected users or at unusual times?"
      - "Is there evidence of role chaining or privilege escalation after federation?"
      - "Are federated sessions unusually long or using atypical user agents?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail (AssumeRoleWithSAML, AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity events)"
      - "IdP logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Suspicious Activity"
    description: >
      Look for lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration following federated access.
    checklist:
      - "Is there unusual API activity by federated roles?"
      - "Are there changes to IAM policies or role trust relationships after federation?"
      - "Is there suspicious data access or network connections?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail"
      - "IAM policy change logs"
      - "Network flow logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Expected and legitimate AWS SSO/federated access consistent with business operations."
      - "Medium: Suspicious timing, location, or pattern of federated login."
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized or malicious use of AWS SSO or federated identities."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear logs showing unexpected federated role assumptions with suspicious activity."
      - "Medium: Unusual login patterns without confirmed malicious action."
      - "Low: Possible false positives due to legitimate automation or cloud management tools."

ioc_types:
  - "AWS SSO ConsoleLogin events from unusual IPs"
  - "AssumeRoleWithSAML or AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity events from unexpected users"
  - "Long or repeated federated sessions"
  - "Suspicious API calls post-federation"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect AWS SSO Console Login From Unfamiliar IPs"
    query: >
      eventName="ConsoleLogin" AND userIdentity.type="AssumedRole" AND sourceIPAddress NOT IN ["<trusted IP list>"]
  - name: "Detect Federated Role Assumption via SAML"
    query: >
      eventName="AssumeRoleWithSAML" AND userIdentity.sessionContext.sessionIssuer.userName NOT IN ["<expected users>"]
  - name: "Detect Federated Role Assumption via Web Identity"
    query: >
      eventName="AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on AWS SSO login from unusual IP or geolocation."
  - "Trigger investigation on unexpected federated role assumptions."
  - "Automatically revoke suspicious federated sessions."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate federated login attempts with identity provider teams."
  - "Check for any privilege escalation or unusual activity following federated access."
  - "Review trust relationships and IAM role permissions for federated roles."
  - "Contain and remediate compromised federated sessions or credentials promptly."
