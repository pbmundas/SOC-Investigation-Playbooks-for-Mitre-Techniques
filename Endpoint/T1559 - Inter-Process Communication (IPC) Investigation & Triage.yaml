tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1559"
technique_name: "Inter-Process Communication (IPC)"
description: >
  Playbook to investigate suspicious use or abuse of IPC mechanisms (e.g., named pipes, shared memory, sockets) 
  that adversaries use to maintain persistence, communicate between malware components, or evade detection.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify IPC Channel Creation or Modification"
    description: >
      Detect creation, modification, or usage of IPC channels such as named pipes, Unix domain sockets, or shared memory.
    checklist:
      - "What IPC channels were created or used recently?"
      - "Are the IPC endpoints unusual or named after known malicious patterns?"
      - "Are any processes communicating over IPC linked to suspicious binaries?"
    data_sources:
      - "OS Audit logs"
      - "EDR IPC monitoring"
      - "Network and socket monitoring"
      - "Process execution logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze IPC Communication Content and Behavior"
    description: >
      Examine the nature of data transmitted over IPC and the behavior of communicating processes.
    checklist:
      - "Is the IPC used to transmit encoded or encrypted data?"
      - "Are there signs of command-and-control or data exfiltration via IPC?"
      - "Is IPC activity timed with other suspicious process activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "Memory analysis tools"
      - "Network/IPC traffic capture"
      - "Behavioral analytics"
      - "Threat intelligence"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate IPC Use with Persistence or Execution Chains"
    description: >
      Link IPC channels with persistence mechanisms or multi-stage payload execution.
    checklist:
      - "Does IPC facilitate launch or control of secondary payloads?"
      - "Is there a known malware or attacker tool leveraging IPC in the environment?"
      - "Are other attack vectors or persistence techniques active alongside IPC use?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process parent-child trees"
      - "Malware sandbox reports"
      - "Threat intelligence"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "User and Contextual Validation"
    description: >
      Validate the legitimacy of IPC usage against user roles and expected system behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Are the communicating processes from expected system or user accounts?"
      - "Is the IPC usage consistent with authorized software?"
      - "Is there anomalous behavior surrounding IPC activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "User session logs"
      - "Application whitelisting data"
      - "SIEM alerts and correlation"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate software IPC usage."
      - "Medium: Unusual IPC channel names or timing."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious IPC communication or control channel."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known bad IOC or malware IPC patterns."
      - "Medium: Suspicious IPC requiring deeper investigation."
      - "Low: Expected IPC activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Named pipe names and paths"
  - "Unix domain socket paths"
  - "Shared memory segment identifiers"
  - "Process IDs using IPC channels"
  - "IPC communication payload hashes"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Named Pipe Creation"
    query: >
      event.type:"pipe_create" AND event.timestamp:>=now-1d
  - name: "Suspicious IPC Channel Names"
    query: >
      ipc.channel_name:("*evil*" OR "*malware*" OR "*backdoor*")
  - name: "Process Communication via IPC"
    query: >
      process.name:* AND ipc.channel_usage:true AND process.command_line:*

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on creation of IPC channels with suspicious names"
  - "Capture and analyze IPC payloads for malware patterns"
  - "Trigger sandbox analysis for processes communicating over suspicious IPC"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review IPC usage in context of known application behavior."
  - "Analyze suspicious IPC channel names and associated processes."
  - "Correlate IPC events with other detection telemetry."
  - "Document findings and escalate as needed."
