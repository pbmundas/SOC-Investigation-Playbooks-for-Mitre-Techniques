technique_name: "Unix Shell"
description: >
  Detects execution of Unix/Linux shell interpreters (bash, sh, dash, etc.), often used in post-compromise scripts
  or for direct command execution.

detection_sources:
  - Auditd (execve)
  - Sysmon for Linux
  - EDR or SIEM integrations
  - Shell history logs

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Shell Execution"
    checklist:
      - "Look for executions of /bin/bash, /bin/sh, /usr/bin/zsh, etc."
      - "Capture the command line and parent processes"
      - "Check whether the shell is interactive or non-interactive (scripted)"

      - "Correlate with user activity or privilege escalation attempts"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Remediation"
    checklist:
      - "Contain user or system access"
      - "Review audit trails"
      - "Search for rootkits or persistent agents"

triage_labels:
  - severity: Medium to High
  - confidence: Variable (based on behavior)

ioc_types:
  - Command Path
  - Script Content
  - User
