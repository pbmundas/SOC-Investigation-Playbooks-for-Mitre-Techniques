playbook_name: "T1562 - Defense Control Disabling Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1562"
technique_name: "Impair Defenses"
description: >
  Detect and investigate actions that attempt to disable or tamper with security controls such as AV, EDR, firewall, or security policies.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Security Tool Interference"
    description: >
      Monitor logs and APIs for interactions with known security controls.
    checklist:
      - "Was a security service stopped or disabled?"
      - "Were registry keys related to AV/EDR modified?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Event Logs"
      - "Registry Auditing"
      - "Service monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Process Behavior"
    description: >
      Identify if processes are trying to terminate or suspend security-related services.
    checklist:
      - "Are there taskkill or net stop commands?"
      - "Are non-administrative users altering services?"
    data_sources:
      - "Command-line logs"
      - "Process execution telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Known Threat Behavior"
    description: >
      Compare activity with known attacker tradecraft.
    checklist:
      - "Does it match known malware disabling defenses?"
      - "Was this activity observed during infection or exploitation phases?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"
      - "EDR alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Routine administrative service change."
      - "Medium: Unexpected stop of a critical service."
      - "High: Confirmed disabling of multiple defenses."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known malicious patterns."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but no lateral indicators."
      - "Low: Single, isolated event."

ioc_types:
  - "Service stop commands"
  - "AV/EDR registry modification"
  - "Terminated defense processes"

queries/examples:
