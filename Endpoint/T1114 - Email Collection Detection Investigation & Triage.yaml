playbook_name: "T1114 - Email Collection Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1114"
technique_name: "Email Collection"
description: >
  Detects adversaries collecting email data from local or remote sources, which may contain sensitive information or credentials.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to Email Clients and Mail Stores"
    description: >
      Identify unusual access or read operations on email client data stores (e.g., Outlook PST files, Thunderbird profiles).
    checklist:
      - "Are there processes accessing email storage files outside of normal user behavior?"
      - "Is there a spike in file reads or copies of email data?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Process creation and file access logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Email Collection Tools or Scripts"
    description: >
      Identify suspicious tools or scripts used to collect emails locally or remotely.
    checklist:
      - "Are there known email scraping or harvesting tools executed?"
      - "Are there PowerShell or script commands targeting email clients or servers?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Command-line auditing"
      - "Script execution logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Email Collection with Data Exfiltration"
    description: >
      Observe if collected emails are transferred outside the organization.
    checklist:
      - "Is there outbound network traffic containing email data?"
      - "Are emails sent to unauthorized external addresses?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic monitoring"
      - "Email gateway logs"
      - "Data loss prevention (DLP) logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Collection by authorized personnel or automated backups."
      - "Medium: Suspicious collection activity without confirmed exfiltration."
      - "High: Malicious email collection linked to data exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed collection followed by exfiltration."
      - "Medium: Detected access to email stores by suspicious processes."
      - "Low: Normal user activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to Outlook PST/OST files or similar mail stores"
  - "Execution of email harvesting tools or scripts"
  - "Unusual outbound transfer of email content"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Access to Outlook PST Files"
    query: >
      file.path ENDSWITH ".pst" AND
      event.type = "file_access" AND
      process.name NOT IN ("outlook.exe", "office.exe")

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Email Harvesting Commands"
    query: >
      process.name = "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line CONTAINS ("Get-Mailbox", "Export-Mailbox")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized access to mail stores."
  - "Block known email collection tools."
  - "Notify security operations on detected exfiltration attempts."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if email collection is part of legitimate business processes."
  - "Review user context and process ancestry."
  - "Investigate associated network connections and data transfers."
