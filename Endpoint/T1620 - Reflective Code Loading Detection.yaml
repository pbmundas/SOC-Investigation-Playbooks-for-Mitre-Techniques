playbook_name: "T1620 - Reflective Code Loading Detection"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1620"
technique_name: "Reflective Code Loading"
description: >
  Detects malware and adversaries loading code reflectively into process memory to evade detection.

detection_sources:
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  - Windows Sysmon (EventID 8 - CreateRemoteThread)
  - Memory analysis tools
  - API call monitoring (e.g., VirtualAlloc, WriteProcessMemory)

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Reflective Code Injection Events"
    description: >
      Identify suspicious use of reflective loading techniques.
    checklist:
      - "Monitor API calls related to reflective loading (e.g., VirtualAlloc, NtMapViewOfSection)"
      - "Detect abnormal process/thread creation events"
      - "Look for in-memory execution without corresponding files on disk"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR"
      - "Sysmon"
      - "Memory forensics"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Suspicious Processes"
    description: >
      Investigate processes involved in reflective loading.
    checklist:
      - "Check parent/child process relationships"
      - "Identify unsigned or anomalous modules loaded"
      - "Check for network connections or C2 activity"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Network logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Response"
    description: >
      Contain and remediate compromised systems.
    checklist:
      - "Isolate affected endpoints"
      - "Run deep malware scans"
      - "Collect memory dumps for forensic analysis"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "Forensics tools"

triage_labels:
  - severity:
      - "High: Confirmed reflective code loading"
  - confidence:
      - "High: API monitoring or EDR alerts"
      - "Medium: Anomalous process/thread creation"
