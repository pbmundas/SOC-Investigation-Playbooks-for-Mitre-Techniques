playbook_name: "T1036.002 - System Utility Rename Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1036.002"
technique_name: "System Utility Rename"
description: >
  Detect adversaries renaming system utilities to evade detection or masquerade as legitimate files.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Renamed System Utilities"
    description: >
      Scan file systems for known system utilities with altered file names.
    checklist:
      - "Are common system utilities renamed to non-standard names?"
      - "Are renamed utilities located outside expected directories?"
      - "Is the rename recent and unauthorized?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system inventory"
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "Endpoint logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Validate File Signatures and Hashes"
    description: >
      Verify digital signatures and file hashes against known good baselines.
    checklist:
      - "Are signatures invalid or missing?"
      - "Do hashes differ from known system utility files?"
    data_sources:
      - "Digital signature logs"
      - "Threat intelligence databases"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Monitor Execution of Renamed Utilities"
    description: >
      Observe execution patterns and check for suspicious behavior from renamed utilities.
    checklist:
      - "Are renamed utilities used for privilege escalation or persistence?"
      - "Do they spawn unexpected child processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Mitigate"
    description: >
      Restore proper utility names and alert on unauthorized renaming attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Rename utilities back to standard names."
      - "Create alerts for future renames."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "SIEM"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized renames for system maintenance."
      - "Medium: Suspicious renames without clear intent."
      - "High: Malicious renames linked to attack."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed malicious activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed."
      - "Low: False positive."

ioc_types:
  - "Renamed system utilities"
  - "Unsigned or altered binaries"
  - "Execution from unusual paths"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect renamed system utilities"
    query: >
      file.name.keyword NOT IN ["cmd.exe", "powershell.exe", "net.exe", "sc.exe"] AND
      file.original_name.keyword IN ["cmd.exe", "powershell.exe", "net.exe", "sc.exe"]

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on creation or modification of renamed system utilities."
  - "Trigger integrity checks on system binaries."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Check if rename is approved for maintenance."
  - "Correlate with suspicious process activity."
