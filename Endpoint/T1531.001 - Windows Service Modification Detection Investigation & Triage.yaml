playbook_name: "T1531.001 - Windows Service Modification Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1531.001"
technique_name: "Windows Service Modification"
description: >
  Detects adversaries modifying Windows services to evade defenses, maintain persistence, or escalate privileges by altering service configurations, binaries, or parameters.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Windows Service Configuration Changes"
    description: >
      Track changes to Windows service startup types, binary paths, and parameters using system event logs.
    checklist:
      - "Are there service startup type changes logged (Event ID 7040)?"
      - "Are service binary paths modified unexpectedly (Event ID 7045)?"
      - "Are there changes made by non-administrative or unusual accounts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Event Logs (System)"
      - "File integrity monitoring on service binaries"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Unauthorized Service Executable Changes"
    description: >
      Identify replaced or altered service executables, particularly if pointing to suspicious or new binaries.
    checklist:
      - "Are service executables replaced or altered outside of patching cycles?"
      - "Is the new executable location unknown or unapproved?"
    data_sources:
      - "File monitoring and hash comparisons"
      - "Windows Sysmon logs (Event ID 11, 12)"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Service Modifications with Malicious Behavior"
    description: >
      Investigate other signs of compromise such as suspicious process creation or privilege escalations following service changes.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected processes spawned by modified services?"
      - "Is there evidence of persistence mechanisms related to modified services?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Scheduled task logs"
      - "Security event logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized service changes during maintenance."
      - "Medium: Suspicious modifications requiring further validation."
      - "High: Unauthorized service modifications linked to compromise."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified unauthorized service modifications with malicious activity."
      - "Medium: Unexplained service changes without confirmed impact."
      - "Low: Legitimate service modification events."

ioc_types:
  - "Windows Event ID 7040 - Service startup type changed"
  - "Windows Event ID 7045 - Service installed or modified"
  - "Changes to service executable files or paths"
  - "Service modification by non-standard user accounts"

queries/examples:

automation_hooks:
  - "Generate alerts for unexpected service modifications."
  - "Automatically quarantine or restore legitimate service binaries."
  - "Notify security operations center (SOC) and system administrators."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if service changes correspond to authorized updates."
  - "Investigate any related suspicious process or login activity."
  - "Recommend implementation of service hardening and monitoring policies."
