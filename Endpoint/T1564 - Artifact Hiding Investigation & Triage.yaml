technique_id: "T1564"
technique_name: "Artifact Hiding"
description: >
  Detect attempts by adversaries to hide artifacts such as files, directories, or user accounts to evade detection.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Anomalies in Artifact Visibility"
    description: >
      Investigate for artifacts that are hidden via OS features or manipulation (e.g., hidden attributes, alternate data streams, or modified ACLs).
    checklist:
      - "Are there files or directories with hidden or system attributes?"
      - "Are there artifacts hidden in alternate data streams?"
      - "Are normal system visibility settings modified?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Endpoint detection telemetry"
      - "Integrity monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Hidden Users or Accounts"
    description: >
      Review user account listings for hidden or disabled users that may be used for persistence or stealth access.
    checklist:
      - "Are there user accounts with hidden or disabled flags?"
      - "Are any accounts missing from standard enumeration tools but present in low-level queries?"
      - "Are there anomalies in user creation/modification logs?"
    data_sources:
      - "Active Directory logs"
      - "Local user account audits"
      - "Authentication and authorization logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious Activity"
    description: >
      Correlate hidden artifacts or users with other suspicious behaviors like privilege escalation, lateral movement, or persistence.
    checklist:
      - "Are hidden files linked to malware or scripts?"
      - "Are hidden users performing unauthorized actions?"
      - "Is there evidence of access or usage of hidden artifacts?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM logs"
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"
      - "Endpoint telemetry"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Mitigate"
    description: >
      Remove or reveal hidden artifacts, disable unauthorized accounts, and enhance monitoring and control.
    checklist:
      - "Remove or quarantine suspicious hidden files or directories."
      - "Disable or delete unauthorized hidden users."
      - "Harden file system and user visibility configurations."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "Access control logs"
      - "Incident response tools"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate hidden artifacts or users."
      - "Medium: Suspicious hiding activities requiring investigation."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious hiding to evade detection."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious hiding."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed."
      - "Low: Benign or system-related hiding."

ioc_types:
  - "Files/directories with hidden/system attributes"
  - "User accounts with hidden or disabled flags"
  - "Unusual alternate data streams"
  - "Unexpected user enumeration results"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect hidden files/directories (Windows)"
    query: >
      (file.attributes:hidden OR file.attributes:system) AND NOT file.path:known_system_files

  - name: "List hidden user accounts (Windows)"
    query: >
      user.account.hidden:true OR user.account.disabled:true

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on detection of hidden files or directories in sensitive paths."
  - "Alert on creation or modification of hidden or disabled user accounts."
  - "Trigger analyst review upon detection."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate whether hidden artifacts are part of normal system operations."
  - "Check user account status and creation/modification logs."
  - "Correlate with other threat indicators or alerts."
  - "Engage incident response if malicious hiding is confirmed."
