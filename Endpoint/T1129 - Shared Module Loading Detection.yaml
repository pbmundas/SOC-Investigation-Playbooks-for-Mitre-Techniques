description: >
  Adversaries may abuse shared modules (DLLs or libraries) to load malicious functionality into legitimate processes.

detection_sources:
  - Sysmon (Event ID 7 - ImageLoad)
  - EDR (DLL Injection)
  - Process command-line logs

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Review Shared Library Usage"
    checklist:
      - "Check if DLL is unsigned or anomalous"
      - "Look for DLLs loaded from temp/user-writable directories"
      - "Check if DLL name mimics system components"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Load Context"
    checklist:
      - "Was the DLL loaded by a legitimate binary?"
      - "Check for sideloading patterns or LOLBins"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Respond & Contain"
    checklist:
      - "Quarantine the file and process"
      - "Collect memory dump for injected code"
      - "Check other endpoints for the same DLL"

triage_labels:
  - severity: High
  - confidence: High

ioc_types:
  - DLL path/name
  - File hash
  - Parent process
