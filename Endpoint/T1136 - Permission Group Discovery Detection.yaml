playbook_name: "T1136 - Permission Group Discovery Detection"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1136"
technique_name: "Permission Groups Discovery"
description: >
  Helps analysts detect reconnaissance activities where adversaries enumerate permission groups
  to identify high-value targets or lateral movement opportunities.

detection_sources:
  - Active Directory logs
  - Windows Security Event Logs (EventID 4728, 4729, 4732, 4733)
  - SIEM alerts on LDAP queries or group enumeration
  - Endpoint logs

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Group Enumeration Activity"
    description: >
      Detect unusual or suspicious queries for permission group membership.
    checklist:
      - "Monitor events related to group membership enumeration (e.g., EventID 4728, 4732)"
      - "Check for high frequency or unusual source accounts"
      - "Correlate with threat intelligence on known reconnaissance tactics"
    data_sources:
      - "Active Directory logs"
      - "SIEM"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Account Behavior"
    description: >
      Investigate accounts performing group discovery.
    checklist:
      - "Verify if account is privileged or service account"
      - "Check login patterns and times"
      - "Review recent activity for suspicious behavior"
    data_sources:
      - "User account logs"
      - "UEBA systems"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Containment"
    description: >
      Restrict or monitor suspicious accounts and actions.
    checklist:
      - "Limit account privileges if suspicious"
      - "Apply multi-factor authentication"
      - "Increase monitoring"
    data_sources:
      - "Identity management systems"

triage_labels:
  - severity:
      - "Low: Single group enumeration event"
      - "Medium: Multiple enumerations from non-privileged accounts"
      - "High: Enumeration from suspected compromised accounts"
  - confidence:
      - "High: Verified suspicious activity"
      - "Medium: Unusual but inconclusive"
      - "Low: Normal administrative activity"
