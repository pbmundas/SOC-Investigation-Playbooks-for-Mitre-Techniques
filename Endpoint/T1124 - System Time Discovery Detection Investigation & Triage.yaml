playbook_name: "T1124 - System Time Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1124"
technique_name: "System Time Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries querying system time settings to synchronize actions or evade detection by mimicking legitimate system time behaviors.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor System Time Query Commands and API Calls"
    description: >
      Identify commands, scripts, or API calls querying system time, such as `date`, `time`, `Get-Date`, or Windows API calls.
    checklist:
      - "Are processes querying system time using command-line or scripting tools?"
      - "Is there unusual or repeated time querying activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line auditing"
      - "API monitoring logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Suspicious or Frequent Time Queries"
    description: >
      Look for abnormal patterns of system time discovery, especially if from suspicious or compromised accounts.
    checklist:
      - "Is time discovery activity concentrated during off-hours?"
      - "Are frequent or automated queries observed?"
    data_sources:
      - "User activity logs"
      - "Endpoint monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Time Discovery with Evasion or Timing Attacks"
    description: >
      Determine if system time queries are correlated with attempts to evade detection or synchronize attacks.
    checklist:
      - "Is time querying linked to suspicious process execution?"
      - "Are there related signs of time-based evasion techniques?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection logs"
      - "Security event correlation"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate system time queries by administrators or monitoring tools."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or automated time queries."
      - "High: Time discovery linked to evasion or attack staging."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized system time queries."
      - "Medium: Suspicious queries without full context."
      - "Low: Routine operations."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of date/time commands or PowerShell Get-Date"
  - "Windows API time query calls"
  - "Repeated time queries in short intervals"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect PowerShell Get-Date Usage"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-Date"

  - name: "Detect Linux Date Command"
    query: >
      process.name == "date"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious system time queries."
  - "Monitor for automated or scripted time queries."
  - "Investigate linked suspicious activity for evasion."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm legitimacy of time query activities."
  - "Correlate with other reconnaissance or evasion techniques."
  - "Recommend enhanced logging of time-based commands."
