playbook_name: "T1486 - Ransomware/Data Encryption Detection"
tactic: "Impact"
technique_id: "T1486"
technique_name: "Data Encrypted for Impact"
description: >
  Detect ransomware activity or other malicious encryption of data to disrupt availability.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Mass File Encryption Activity"
    description: >
      Look for processes performing bulk file modifications consistent with encryption.
    checklist:
      - "Are there processes accessing a large number of files in a short period?"
      - "Are file extensions being changed or new encrypted files created?"
      - "Are known ransomware processes or variants detected?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection and response (EDR)"
      - "File system audit logs"
      - "Process monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor for Ransom Notes or Payload Delivery"
    description: >
      Detect presence of ransom notes or files indicating ransomware infection.
    checklist:
      - "Are ransom note files created on multiple hosts?"
      - "Are network connections observed to ransomware C2 infrastructure?"
    data_sources:
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "Network traffic logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with User or Process Behavior"
    description: >
      Assess if suspicious user accounts or processes are involved.
    checklist:
      - "Is a compromised user account or privileged process executing encryption?"
      - "Is there lateral movement preceding encryption?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "EDR telemetry"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate encryption or backup operations."
      - "Medium: Suspicious encryption activity."
      - "High: Confirmed ransomware encryption."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified ransomware events."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Mass file modification"
  - "Ransom note file creation"
  - "Ransomware process hashes or signatures"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Large File Encryption"
    query: >
      process.name IN (ransomware_tools) AND
      file.operation = "modify" AND
      file.count > threshold

  - name: "Detect Ransom Note Files"
    query: >
      file.name CONTAINS ("README", "HELP", "DECRYPT") AND
      file.created_time > recent_timeframe

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert and isolate affected endpoints."
  - "Trigger incident response playbook."
  - "Block ransomware C2 IPs/domains."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if activity is malicious or maintenance."
  - "Engage backup and recovery teams."
  - "Perform containment and eradication."
