playbook_name: "T1563.003 - SSH Session Hijacking Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1563.003"
technique_name: "SSH Session Hijacking"
description: >
  Detects adversaries hijacking active SSH sessions to gain unauthorized access or maintain persistence without needing credentials.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor SSH Session Activity"
    description: >
      Track SSH session establishment, disconnections, and concurrent connections to identify anomalies.
    checklist:
      - "Are there multiple SSH sessions open for the same user from different IPs?"
      - "Are there abrupt SSH session disconnections and reconnections?"
    data_sources:
      - "SSH server logs"
      - "Network logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Suspicious SSH Client Behavior"
    description: >
      Detect SSH connections from unusual IP addresses, geolocations, or rapid session switching.
    checklist:
      - "Are there connections from IPs outside normal user range?"
      - "Is there evidence of automated or scripted SSH connections?"
    data_sources:
      - "SSH logs"
      - "Network flow monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Hijacking with Malicious Activity"
    description: >
      Look for malicious commands, privilege escalations, or lateral movement following session hijacking.
    checklist:
      - "Are there suspicious command executions post-connection?"
      - "Is there evidence of lateral movement or data exfiltration?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process logs"
      - "File access logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Typical SSH session patterns."
      - "Medium: Suspicious session anomalies."
      - "High: Confirmed SSH session hijacking."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified session hijacking with malicious actions."
      - "Medium: Anomalous SSH session behavior."
      - "Low: Normal SSH session variations."

ioc_types:
  - "Concurrent SSH sessions from different IPs for same user"
  - "Unusual SSH client IP addresses"
  - "Rapid SSH session disconnect/reconnect"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Concurrent SSH Sessions"
    query: >
      ssh.session_id EXISTS AND
      count(ssh.connection) > 1 BY user WITHIN 5 minutes

  - name: "Detect SSH Connections from Anomalous IPs"
    query: >
      ssh.connection_ip NOT IN known trusted IPs

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious SSH session anomalies."
  - "Force disconnect suspicious SSH sessions."
  - "Enforce stricter SSH access controls."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify session legitimacy and client IPs."
  - "Check for post-session malicious activity."
  - "Recommend SSH key rotation and MFA."
