playbook_name: "T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys or Startup Folder Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1547.001"
technique_name: "Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder"
description: >
  Detect and investigate persistence mechanisms via Registry run keys or startup folder autostart entries.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Registry Run Keys and Startup Folder Changes"
    description: >
      Detect creation or modification of Registry run keys and files in startup folders.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new or modified entries in Run, RunOnce, or similar keys?"
      - "Are executable or script files added to user startup folders?"
      - "Are entries linked to suspicious or unknown executables?"
    data_sources:
      - "Registry monitoring logs"
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Executables and Scripts in Autostart Locations"
    description: >
      Review files referenced in Registry or startup folders for legitimacy.
    checklist:
      - "Are files signed and trusted?"
      - "Are hashes associated with malware?"
      - "Are timestamps recent or anomalous?"
    data_sources:
      - "File Integrity Monitoring"
      - "Threat intelligence"
      - "EDR alerts"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Autostart Entries with Process and Network Activity"
    description: >
      Investigate if autostart entries result in suspicious process creation or network communication.
    checklist:
      - "Are processes started by autostart entries spawning suspicious child processes?"
      - "Is there outbound communication following autostart execution?"
      - "Are other malicious activities detected?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Network monitoring"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate Changes Against Baseline and User Context"
    description: >
      Determine if changes are legitimate or unauthorized.
    checklist:
      - "Is the user authorized for changes?"
      - "Are entries part of known software?"
      - "Are endpoint protections in place?"
    data_sources:
      - "Change management"
      - "User logs"
      - "EDR status"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized startup entries."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unverified entries."
      - "High: Malicious registry or startup folder entries confirmed."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known threat IOCs."
      - "Medium: Unusual entries without clear impact."
      - "Low: Legitimate but uncommon entries."

ioc_types:
  - "Registry run key names and values"
  - "Startup folder file paths"
  - "File hashes"
  - "Process creation chains"

queries/examples:
  - name: "New or Modified Registry Run Keys"
    query: >
      registry.path:("HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run" OR
      "HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run") AND
      event.action:("registry_value_set" OR "registry_key_created")
  - name: "Executables in User Startup Folder"
    query: >
      file.path:"C:\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\*.exe"
  - name: "Unsigned Executable Started from Startup"
    query: >
      process.command_line:("*StartupFolderPath*") AND file.signed:false

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on creation or modification of registry run keys"
  - "Alert on new executables/scripts in startup folders"
  - "Block or quarantine suspicious files"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm with change and asset management."
  - "Review file signatures and hashes."
  - "Correlate with endpoint and network activity."
  - "Consult threat intelligence sources."
