playbook_name: "T1070.002 - Unix/Mac Log Clearing Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1070.002"
technique_name: "Unix/Mac Log Clearing"
description: >
  Detect deletion or clearing of logs on Unix/Linux/MacOS systems aimed at removing traces of attacker activity.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Deletion or Truncation of System Logs"
    description: >
      Detect removal or truncation of common log files such as /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/syslog, /var/log/messages.
    checklist:
      - "Are log files deleted or truncated unexpectedly?"
      - "Are file permission or ownership changes suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "Auditd or Syslog events"
      - "Filesystem change logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Log Clearing Commands or Tools"
    description: >
      Identify use of commands like 'rm', 'truncate', 'logrotate' used in unusual contexts or times.
    checklist:
      - "Are 'rm' or 'truncate' commands executed on log files by unusual users?"
      - "Is logrotate configuration altered to remove logs prematurely?"
    data_sources:
      - "Shell command history"
      - "Process monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious System Activity"
    description: >
      Look for privilege escalation, suspicious process executions, or unauthorized access around log clearing times.
    checklist:
      - "Are log clearing events timed with suspicious activities?"
      - "Are root or admin privileges involved?"
    data_sources:
      - "Syslog"
      - "Auditd"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Response and Recovery"
    description: >
      Investigate compromised systems, recover logs if possible, and harden logging mechanisms.
    checklist:
      - "Restore logs from backups."
      - "Implement stricter log retention policies."
    data_sources:
      - "Backup systems"
      - "Security monitoring tools"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized log maintenance."
      - "Medium: Unexplained log file deletions."
      - "High: Unauthorized log clearing linked to attacks."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear evidence of malicious log clearing."
      - "Medium: Suspicious command executions."
      - "Low: Routine log rotation."

ioc_types:
  - "Log file deletions or truncations"
  - "Unauthorized 'rm' or 'truncate' commands"
  - "Modified logrotate configs"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Log Deletions with rm command"
    query: >
      process.name:rm AND file.path:/var/log/*
  - name: "Truncate commands on logs"
    query: >
      process.command_line:truncate* AND file.path:/var/log/*

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on deletion/truncation of critical logs."
  - "Trigger investigation workflow on suspicious commands."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify authorized maintenance or log rotation schedules."
  - "Check for privilege escalations around these events."
  - "Coordinate with Unix/Mac system admins and IR."
