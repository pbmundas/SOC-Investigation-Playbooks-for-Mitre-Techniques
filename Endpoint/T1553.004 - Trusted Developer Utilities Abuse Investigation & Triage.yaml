playbook_name: "T1553.004 - Trusted Developer Utilities Abuse: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1553.004"
technique_name: "Trusted Developer Utilities Abuse"
description: >
  Detect misuse of trusted developer utilities or signed binaries to evade detection and execute malicious actions.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Execution of Trusted Developer Utilities in Suspicious Contexts"
    description: >
      Detect when developer utilities (e.g., certutil, msbuild) are used unusually or in ways consistent with abuse.
    checklist:
      - "Are developer utilities running from unexpected locations or by unusual users?"
      - "Is the usage pattern consistent with normal developer workflows?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs"
      - "Command line monitoring"
      - "User behavior analytics"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor for Known Malicious Use Cases"
    description: >
      Detect abuse scenarios such as downloading payloads, encoding data, or bypassing execution controls.
    checklist:
      - "Is certutil or msbuild used to download or decode suspicious files?"
      - "Are developer utilities spawning child processes or executing scripts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Process tree analysis"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Persistence and Lateral Movement"
    description: >
      Link developer utility abuse with persistence mechanisms or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Are there scheduled tasks or services created using these utilities?"
      - "Is lateral movement observed after utility execution?"
    data_sources:
      - "Task scheduler logs"
      - "Service creation events"
      - "Network traffic analysis"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate or Respond"
    description: >
      Confirm abuse of trusted utilities and remediate.
    checklist:
      - "Are impacted systems isolated for investigation?"
      - "Are policies updated to restrict utility use?"
    data_sources:
      - "Incident response"
      - "Endpoint policy management"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate developer activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or uncommon usage patterns."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious use of trusted utilities."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known abuse patterns or IOC matches."
      - "Medium: Unusual execution contexts."
      - "Low: Benign but uncommon use."

ioc_types:
  - "Command line parameters of trusted utilities"
  - "Hashes of suspicious utility binaries or scripts"
  - "User accounts invoking developer utilities"
  - "Network endpoints contacted by utilities"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Certutil Download and Decode"
    query: >
      process.name:"certutil.exe" AND
      (process.command_line:"-urlcache" OR process.command_line:"-decode")
  - name: "Msbuild Suspicious Execution"
    query: >
      process.name:"msbuild.exe" AND
      process.command_line:("*exec*" OR "*script*")
  - name: "Developer Utility Execution by Non-Dev Users"
    query: >
      user.role:NOT_IN("developer", "admin") AND
      process.name:("certutil.exe", "msbuild.exe", "regsvr32.exe")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious usage of trusted developer utilities."
  - "Block flagged command line parameters."
  - "Enforce least privilege and application control policies."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate context of developer utility usage with user and system roles."
  - "Correlate with other suspicious behaviors such as network connections and file writes."
  - "Coordinate with development and security teams for whitelist policies."
