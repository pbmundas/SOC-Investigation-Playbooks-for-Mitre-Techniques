tactic: "Persistence"

technique_name: "DLL Side-loading"
description: >
  Playbook to investigate DLL side-loading where adversaries place a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate executable,
  causing it to load the malicious DLL instead of the intended one for code execution.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect DLLs Present in Executable Directories"
    description: >
      Identify DLL files colocated with executables that are not part of standard software installations.
    checklist:
      - "Are there DLLs in application directories that differ from known files?"
      - "Do the DLLs have suspicious creation or modification timestamps?"
      - "Are DLL hashes flagged as malicious or unknown?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "File Integrity Monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Executable and DLL Relationships"
    description: >
      Review executable processes loading DLLs from their local directory instead of system directories.
    checklist:
      - "Is the executable loading DLLs from its own directory?"
      - "Are the loaded DLLs signed and trusted?"
      - "Are there unusual parent-child process chains?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process DLL load logs"
      - "Process trees"
      - "Binary signature metadata"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Assess Persistence and Malicious Activity"
    description: >
      Check if DLL side-loading is used to establish persistence or for further malicious actions.
    checklist:
      - "Is the executable part of startup or scheduled tasks?"
      - "Are there outbound network connections after DLL load?"
      - "Is there evidence of lateral movement or data exfiltration?"
    data_sources:
      - "Persistence logs"
      - "Network monitoring"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Confirm Legitimate vs Malicious Activity"
    description: >
      Validate the context to differentiate legitimate application behavior from malicious side-loading.
    checklist:
      - "Is the executable trusted and regularly updated?"
      - "Are endpoint protections active?"
      - "Are DLLs properly signed and validated?"
    data_sources:
      - "Patch and update management"
      - "EDR and AV logs"
      - "Threat intelligence"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate software with valid DLLs."
      - "Medium: DLL side-loading suspicious but no confirmed impact."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious DLL side-loading with execution."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: IOC or malware match."
      - "Medium: Anomalous DLL location or behavior."
      - "Low: Known software update or installation."

ioc_types:
  - "DLLs colocated with executables"
  - "File hashes of suspicious DLLs"
  - "Process execution and DLL load logs"
  - "Startup entries or scheduled tasks involving executables"

queries/examples:
