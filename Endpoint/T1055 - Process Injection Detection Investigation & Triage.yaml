playbook_name: "T1055 - Process Injection Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1055"
technique_name: "Process Injection"
description: >
  Detect process injection techniques used to evade defenses or execute malicious code within legitimate processes.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Process Memory Manipulation"
    description: >
      Monitor for suspicious memory allocation and writing behaviors.
    checklist:
      - "Are APIs like WriteProcessMemory, VirtualAllocEx used suspiciously?"
      - "Is shellcode detected in memory?"
    data_sources:
      - "Sysmon (Event ID 10)"
      - "EDR memory events"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Suspicious Process Relationships"
    description: >
      Correlate parent and child processes involved in injection.
    checklist:
      - "Is a non-standard parent process injecting into system processes?"
      - "Is the parent executable unsigned or recently dropped?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process tree logs"
      - "Binary metadata"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Malicious Behavior"
    description: >
      Link injection to malicious payload execution or evasion.
    checklist:
      - "Does the injected process connect to external IPs?"
      - "Is there an increase in anomalous process activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network connections"
      - "Behavior analytics"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate tool behavior (e.g., AV tools)."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed injections."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious injection."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: API and payload matches to known malware."
      - "Medium: Unknown source binary with suspicious injection."
      - "Low: Inconclusive injection events."

ioc_types:
  - "Injected process names"
  - "Memory manipulation API usage"
  - "External connections post-injection"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Suspicious Memory Injection"
