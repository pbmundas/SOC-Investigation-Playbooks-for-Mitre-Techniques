playbook_name: "T1021.003 - DCOM Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Lateral Movement"
technique_id: "T1021.003"
technique_name: "Distributed Component Object Model"
description: >
  Detects adversaries leveraging DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) for remote code execution and lateral movement.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor DCOM Remote Execution Activities"
    description: >
      Identify execution of commands or scripts using DCOM interfaces remotely.
    checklist:
      - "Are there remote procedure calls (RPC) or COM object activations from unusual hosts?"
      - "Are DCOM operations initiated by non-standard users or outside business hours?"
    data_sources:
      - "RPC logs"
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Windows event logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Anomalous DCOM Service Usage"
    description: >
      Track unusual invocation of COM services or use of tools that leverage DCOM.
    checklist:
      - "Are tools like wmiprvse.exe or mmc.exe used abnormally?"
      - "Are there unexpected COM object activations?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "WMI activity logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate DCOM Activity with Other Lateral Movement Indicators"
    description: >
      Look for signs of privilege escalation, credential dumping, or data exfiltration following DCOM use.
    checklist:
      - "Is there suspicious network or process activity following DCOM remote execution?"
      - "Are there concurrent authentication anomalies?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Authentication logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal use of DCOM for administration."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or unusual DCOM activity."
      - "High: Unauthorized or malicious DCOM remote execution."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed malicious DCOM usage."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed."
      - "Low: Routine administrative activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Remote RPC calls invoking DCOM services"
  - "Unusual execution of wmiprvse.exe or related tools"
  - "Unexpected COM object activations"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Remote DCOM Execution"
    query: >
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)(dcom|wmiprvse|mmc)" AND
      network.remote_ip != local_ip

  - name: "Detect RPC Calls Associated with DCOM"
    query: >
      rpc.call.destination_port == 135 AND
      process.name IN ("wmiprvse.exe", "mmc.exe")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious DCOM remote execution."
  - "Restrict RPC and DCOM ports where possible."
  - "Force re-authentication after DCOM alerts."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if DCOM usage is legitimate."
  - "Investigate associated lateral movement activities."
  - "Implement network segmentation and access control."
