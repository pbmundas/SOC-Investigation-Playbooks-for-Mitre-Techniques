playbook_name: "T1074 - Data Staging Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1074"
technique_name: "Data Staging"
description: >
  Detects adversaries collecting and aggregating data in a central location on a compromised system or network before exfiltration.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Unusual Large File Creation or Modification"
    description: >
      Look for creation or modification of large files or archives that could indicate data aggregation.
    checklist:
      - "Are large files (.zip, .rar, .7z, .tar) or unknown file types being created?"
      - "Is file creation/modification occurring in non-standard or temporary directories?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Bulk File Movement or Copying"
    description: >
      Monitor for large scale file copying or movement activities on hosts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there signs of bulk copying from multiple directories to a staging location?"
      - "Are multiple sensitive files accessed in a short time window?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access logs"
      - "Process monitoring logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Staging Activities with Other Indicators"
    description: >
      Correlate data staging activity with other suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration attempts or unusual process execution.
    checklist:
      - "Is the staging followed by network transfer or exfiltration?"
      - "Are the staging activities performed by unusual user accounts or processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network monitoring"
      - "User and process behavior logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: File aggregation activity in known backup or archive processes."
      - "Medium: Suspicious large file creation in uncommon locations."
      - "High: Unapproved bulk data staging activity detected."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious staging activity linked to exfiltration."
      - "Medium: Suspicious staging without clear exfiltration."
      - "Low: Benign staging activity in backup/maintenance contexts."

ioc_types:
  - "Large archive file creation in temporary directories"
  - "Bulk file copy or move operations"
  - "File access patterns indicating data aggregation"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Large Archive File Creation"
    query: >
      file.extension IN (".zip", ".rar", ".7z", ".tar") AND
      file.size > 100MB AND
      file.path CONTAINS ("temp", "tmp", "cache")

  - name: "Detect Bulk File Copy Operations"
    query: >
      process.name IN ("copy.exe", "robocopy.exe") AND
      file.access_count > 50 WITHIN 10 minutes

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on large archive creation in suspicious locations."
  - "Monitor and restrict bulk file copy/move operations."
  - "Notify SOC team for further investigation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if staging is part of authorized backup or maintenance."
  - "Check for related exfiltration or suspicious network activity."
  - "Review user/process context for legitimacy."
