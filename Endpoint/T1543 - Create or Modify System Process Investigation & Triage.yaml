playbook_name: "T1543 - Create or Modify System Process: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1543"
technique_name: "Create or Modify System Process"
description: >
  Investigation-centric playbook to identify and respond to adversary techniques that create or modify 
  system-level processes to achieve persistence, elevate privileges, or evade defenses.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Alert and Process Context Review"
    description: >
      Validate alert and examine how the process was created or modified. Determine user context and source.
    checklist:
      - "Was a system process created/modified via scripts or untrusted binaries?"
      - "What is the associated parent process?"
      - "Is the target process in a sensitive path (e.g., system32, bin)?"
      - "Was the process launched with elevated privileges?"
    data_sources:
      - "Sysmon Process Creation Logs"
      - "Windows Security Logs (event 4688)"
      - "Linux Audit Logs"
      - "Process Execution Metadata"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Command-Line and Registry Analysis"
    description: >
      Check command-line, startup flags, and registry keys associated with system process changes.
    checklist:
      - "Is there use of suspicious flags or parameters?"
      - "Are there registry keys being added/modified for persistence?"
      - "Does the process autostart on boot or logon?"
    data_sources:
      - "Registry Change Logs"
      - "Command-Line Logs"
      - "EDR Process Tree"
      - "Scheduled Task Metadata"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Binary Integrity and Reputation Check"
    description: >
      Evaluate whether the modified or new process binary is trustworthy.
    checklist:
      - "Is the binary signed by a known vendor?"
      - "Is it stored in a known or trusted path?"
      - "Does its hash match known malware or suspicious software?"
    data_sources:
      - "Binary Metadata"
      - "Threat Intelligence Platforms"
      - "File Reputation Sources (VT, ReversingLabs)"
      - "Endpoint Binary Inventory"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Scope and Lateral Impact Assessment"
    description: >
      Investigate how the change affects the broader system and network.
    checklist:
      - "Has this binary been seen on other systems recently?"
      - "Did the process launch child processes or network connections?"
      - "Is there persistence or privilege escalation linked to the process?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network Flow Logs"
      - "EDR Lateral Movement Events"
      - "SIEM Correlation Rules"
      - "File Spread Timeline"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized admin changes to system process."
      - "Medium: Unusual process creation by non-admin user."
      - "High: Unsigned binary used to modify/initiate a system-level process."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known malicious hash or strong indicators in binary."
      - "Medium: Suspicious location or user action, limited behavioral evidence."
      - "Low: Noisy behavior or rare admin task."

ioc_types:
  - "Modified system binary hash"
  - "Command-line arguments"
  - "Registry persistence keys"
  - "Service/task name"
  - "Network destinations post-process execution"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Suspicious Process Start in System Folder"
    query: >
      process.name:(*.exe) AND process.path:(C:\\Windows\\System32\\*) AND NOT signature.trusted:true
  - name: "Unexpected Process Modification"
    query: >
      registry.key_modified:(*CurrentVersion\\Run OR *Services*) AND process.parent.name:(powershell.exe OR cmd.exe)
  - name: "System Process with Network Activity"
    query: >
      process.name:(svchost.exe OR cron OR init) AND network.direction:outbound

automation_hooks:
  - "Auto-query binary hash with VT and submit to sandbox"
  - "Generate watchlist of modified processes across hosts"
  - "Trigger isolation workflow if suspicious process is unsigned and persistent"
  - "Auto-tag registry events with MITRE T1543 if matched"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review parent-child relationships to determine initiation method."
  - "Validate binary metadata and digital signatures."
  - "Check process creation frequency and if tied to legitimate software deployment."
  - "Escalate if tied to known malware patterns (e.g., TrickBot, Cobalt Strike)."
