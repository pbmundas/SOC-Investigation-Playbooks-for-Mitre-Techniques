playbook_name: "T1071.004 - DNS Protocol Command and Control Detection"
tactic: "Command and Control"
technique_id: "T1071.004"
technique_name: "DNS Protocol"
description: >
  Detect adversaries using DNS queries and responses for command and control communication.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor DNS Traffic for Anomalies"
    description: >
      Analyze DNS queries for unusual domains, query types, and volume spikes.
    checklist:
      - "Are there DNS requests to suspicious or newly registered domains?"
      - "Is there an unusual number of TXT, CNAME, or NULL queries?"
      - "Are DNS queries unusually large or contain encoded data?"
    data_sources:
      - "DNS logs"
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "Firewall logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Known Malicious Domains and IPs"
    description: >
      Match DNS queries against threat intelligence for known malicious domains used in DNS-based C2.
    checklist:
      - "Are DNS queries resolving to known malicious IPs?"
      - "Are queried domains flagged as low reputation or suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"
      - "DNS logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Identify DNS Tunneling or Data Encoding"
    description: >
      Detect patterns of DNS tunneling such as unusually long domain names or encoded query data.
    checklist:
      - "Are domain names unusually long or random?"
      - "Is there high frequency of TXT record queries?"
      - "Is encoded data detected in DNS queries?"
    data_sources:
      - "DNS traffic analysis tools"
      - "Network IDS/IPS alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal DNS traffic."
      - "Medium: Suspicious DNS query patterns."
      - "High: Confirmed DNS-based C2 activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: IOC match or confirmed DNS tunneling."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies without IOC confirmation."
      - "Low: Possible false positives due to legitimate DNS use."

ioc_types:
  - "Malicious or suspicious domain names"
  - "Unusual DNS query types (TXT, NULL)"
  - "Encoded or tunneled DNS query data"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect DNS Queries with Long or Random Domains"
    query: >
      length(dns.query_name) > 50 OR
      dns.query_name MATCHES "[a-z0-9]{15,}"

  - name: "Detect High Volume of DNS TXT Queries"
    query: >
      dns.query_type = "TXT" AND
      count_over_time > threshold

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on anomalous DNS query patterns."
  - "Block queries to known malicious domains."
  - "Trigger endpoint investigation for potential DNS tunneling."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review domain registration and reputation."
  - "Correlate DNS activity with endpoint network connections."
  - "Check for related lateral movement or exfiltration."
