playbook_name: "T1114.001 - Local Email Collection Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1114.001"
technique_name: "Local Email Collection"
description: >
  Detects adversaries collecting email data from local email clients or mail stores on compromised hosts.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Unusual Access to Local Mail Stores"
    description: >
      Detect access or copying of local email store files such as PST, OST, or MBOX files.
    checklist:
      - "Are non-standard processes accessing mail stores?"
      - "Is there an unusual increase in file read or copy operations?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access logs"
      - "Process monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Email Harvesting Scripts or Tools Running Locally"
    description: >
      Monitor for scripts or binaries designed to extract email data from local clients.
    checklist:
      - "Are email scraping tools executed?"
      - "Are PowerShell or batch scripts accessing mail client data?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line audit logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Local Email Access with Data Exfiltration Attempts"
    description: >
      Look for suspicious data uploads or transfers following local email access.
    checklist:
      - "Is email data transferred over network?"
      - "Are suspicious file uploads or email forwarding observed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network monitoring"
      - "DLP and proxy logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized backups or user access."
      - "Medium: Suspicious local email collection activity."
      - "High: Malicious local email harvesting linked to exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed tool execution and data transfer."
      - "Medium: Suspicious file access patterns."
      - "Low: Routine user behavior."

ioc_types:
  - "Unusual process accessing PST/OST/MBOX files"
  - "Execution of local email harvesting tools"
  - "Outbound data transfers containing email content"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Access to Local Mail Stores by Non-Mail Processes"
    query: >
      file.path MATCHES ("*.pst|*.ost|*.mbox") AND
      process.name NOT IN ("outlook.exe", "thunderbird.exe")

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Commands Harvesting Local Emails"
    query: >
      process.name = "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line CONTAINS ("Export-Mailbox", "Get-Content *.pst")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious local mail store access."
  - "Block known harvesting tools execution."
  - "Notify incident response for potential data theft."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Check if access aligns with user roles and schedules."
  - "Investigate process lineage for suspicious parent processes."
  - "Look for concurrent network data transfers."
