playbook_name: "T1218.002 - Mshta Execution Monitoring: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1218.002"
technique_name: "Mshta Execution Monitoring"
description: >
  Detect abuse of mshta.exe (Microsoft HTML Application Host) to execute malicious HTA applications or scripts.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Mshta Execution"
    description: >
      Monitor process creation events for mshta.exe, especially with suspicious scripts or remote URLs.
    checklist:
      - "Are mshta.exe invocations using suspicious HTA files or URLs?"
      - "Is mshta.exe run by unusual users or processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command line logging"
      - "Network logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Command Line and Script Behavior"
    description: >
      Investigate mshta execution command lines and downloaded HTA content.
    checklist:
      - "Are remote HTA files executed?"
      - "Are local HTA files suspicious or unexpected?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process command line logs"
      - "File monitoring"
      - "Network traffic"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious Activity"
    description: >
      Identify concurrent suspicious processes or network connections.
    checklist:
      - "Are mshta executions accompanied by persistence or lateral movement?"
      - "Are user credentials or systems compromised?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM correlation"
      - "Endpoint telemetry"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Incident Response"
    description: >
      Block or isolate affected hosts, restrict mshta execution if possible.
    checklist:
      - "Implement application control to block mshta.exe."
      - "Engage incident response for further investigation."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint controls"
      - "IR tools"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate mshta use."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or unexpected mshta usage."
      - "High: Confirmed mshta abuse for malicious activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed malicious execution."
      - "Medium: Suspicious indicators present."
      - "Low: Benign use."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious mshta.exe command lines"
  - "Remote HTA file execution"
  - "Unusual parent-child process relationships"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect mshta executing remote HTA"
    query: >
      process.name:mshta.exe AND process.command_line:*http*://*.hta
  - name: "Mshta executing local HTA"
    query: >
      process.name:mshta.exe AND process.command_line:*.hta

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on mshta.exe execution with remote or suspicious HTA arguments."
  - "Trigger analyst review."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate mshta usage legitimacy."
  - "Investigate related network and file activity."
  - "Coordinate IR if malicious."
