technique_name: "Event Log Clearing"
description: >
  Detect attempts to clear or erase event logs to remove forensic evidence of malicious activity.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Event Log Clear Commands"
    description: >
      Identify usage of commands/tools like 'wevtutil.exe clear-log', 'Clear-EventLog', or Windows API calls that clear logs.
    checklist:
      - "Are commands like Clear-EventLog or wevtutil clear-log executed?"
      - "Are these commands run by unauthorized users or suspicious processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process command line logs"
      - "Windows Event logs (e.g., Security Event ID 1102)"
      - "Endpoint telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor Event Log Clearance Event IDs"
    description: >
      Look for Windows event IDs related to event log clearing activities.
    checklist:
      - "Event ID 1102 (The audit log was cleared)"
      - "Event ID 104 (Security log cleared)"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Security Event Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Suspicious Activities"
    description: >
      Check if event log clearing is associated with suspicious processes, privilege escalation, or malware execution.
    checklist:
      - "Are log clearing events close in time with other suspicious events?"
      - "Is there abnormal account usage around these events?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM logs"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Recover"
    description: >
      Initiate incident response, check for other indicators, and attempt to restore logs from backups.
    checklist:
      - "Isolate compromised systems if needed."
      - "Restore cleared logs if backups exist."
    data_sources:
      - "Backup repositories"
      - "Incident response tools"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized log clearing with documented approval."
      - "Medium: Unexpected log clearing requiring investigation."
      - "High: Unauthorized or suspicious event log clearing."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear evidence of unauthorized event log clearing."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but inconclusive log clearing events."
      - "Low: Benign or scheduled log maintenance."

ioc_types:
  - "Event ID 1102"
  - "Clear-EventLog command"
  - "wevtutil clear-log usage"
