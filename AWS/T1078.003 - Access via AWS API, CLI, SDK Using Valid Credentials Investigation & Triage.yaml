playbook_name: "T1078.003 - Access via AWS API, CLI, SDK Using Valid Credentials: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1078.003"
technique_name: "Valid Accounts - AWS API/CLI/SDK Access"
description: >
  Detect and investigate the use of valid AWS credentials accessed through API, CLI, or SDK, which attackers may abuse for persistence or data exfiltration.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor AWS API, CLI, SDK Access"
    description: >
      Review AWS CloudTrail logs for API calls made via CLI, SDK, or API.
    checklist:
      - "Are calls made from unusual IP addresses or geolocations?"
      - "Is access occurring outside normal hours?"
      - "Are there sudden spikes in API call volume or unusual API actions?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail (API calls)"
      - "AWS IAM credential reports"
      - "AWS CloudWatch Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Unusual or Unauthorized Access"
    description: >
      Detect usage patterns inconsistent with normal user behavior or known service principals.
    checklist:
      - "Is there usage by unknown or new users?"
      - "Are there API calls to sensitive services or actions?"
      - "Is the usage consistent with typical user roles?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail logs"
      - "IAM user and role inventory"
      - "Network geolocation logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Suspicious Activity"
    description: >
      Investigate related suspicious events such as privilege escalation or data access.
    checklist:
      - "Are there policy or permission changes?"
      - "Is there evidence of data exfiltration or lateral movement?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "Network logs"
      - "S3 and other resource access logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known and authorized API access."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access patterns needing review."
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized or anomalous access."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Access from known suspicious IPs or credentials."
      - "Medium: Unusual times or volumes."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "API calls from unusual IP addresses"
  - "Unusual AWS CLI/SDK usage patterns"
  - "Access outside normal hours"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect API Calls Outside Business Hours"
    query: >
      eventName="*" AND NOT eventTime BETWEEN '08:00:00' AND '18:00:00'
  - name: "Detect API Calls from New IP Addresses"
    query: >
      eventName="*" AND sourceIPAddress NOT IN ["<known_ips>"]

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on API usage from unknown IPs or locations."
  - "Block API access if suspicious."
  - "Trigger incident response for anomalous access."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify user identity and intent for suspicious API calls."
  - "Check access key status and history."
  - "Coordinate with security teams for remediation."
