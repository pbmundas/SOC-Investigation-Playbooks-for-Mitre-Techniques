technique_name: "Windows Service Creation"
description: >
  Investigation playbook to detect and triage suspicious creation or modification of Windows services
  which may indicate persistence or privilege escalation activity.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Alert Context Review"
    description: >
      Review alert related to service creation or modification and verify if it's potentially malicious.
    checklist:
      - "Who initiated the service creation/modification (user/process)?"
      - "What is the service name, binary path, and start type?"
      - "Is this a legitimate or expected service in the environment?"
      - "Was it created outside standard software deployment cycles?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Security Event Logs (7045, 4697)"
      - "Sysmon Event ID 6"
      - "EDR Telemetry"
      - "SIEM Alerts"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Service Binary Inspection"
    description: >
      Inspect the executable or script configured to run as part of the service.
    checklist:
      - "Is the binary signed by a trusted vendor?"
      - "Is the path uncommon (e.g., Temp, AppData)?"
      - "Does the binary hash match known malware?"
    data_sources:
      - "Binary Metadata and Hash"
      - "File Reputation Platforms"
      - "Endpoint File Inventory"
      - "PE Analysis Tools"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Service Behavior and Persistence Evaluation"
    description: >
      Analyze how the service behaves post-creation and whether it establishes persistence.
    checklist:
      - "Does it start automatically (Start=Auto)?"
      - "Does it execute network connections or spawn suspicious processes?"
      - "Has it been seen persisting across reboots?"
    data_sources:
      - "Service Configuration Data"
      - "Process Creation Events"
      - "Network Connection Logs"
      - "Persistence Artifacts"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Cross-System Impact Analysis"
    description: >
      Assess whether the same service name or hash appears across other endpoints.
    checklist:
      - "Was the same service installed via script or GPO on multiple machines?"
      - "Does it appear as part of a broader campaign?"
      - "Does the initiating user have administrative privileges?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR Campaign View"
      - "SIEM Aggregated Events"
      - "Active Directory Event Logs"
      - "File Propagation Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known software or agent installation."
      - "Medium: Unsigned service binary with no malicious behavior."
      - "High: Malicious binary or C2 behavior detected post-service execution."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Malicious hash, suspicious parent, and persistence confirmed."
      - "Medium: Suspicious service name or binary in abnormal path."
      - "Low: Rare but potentially benign custom service."

ioc_types:
  - "Service name and path"
  - "Binary hash"
  - "Parent process"
  - "User account initiating creation"
  - "Persistence registry keys"

queries/examples:
  - name: "New Service Creation"
    query: >
      event.code:7045 AND NOT (service.path.keyword:*Program Files* OR *System32*) AND service.start_type:Auto
  - name: "Service Binary in Suspicious Location"
    query: >
      service.path:(*\\Temp\\* OR *\\AppData\\* OR *\\Users\\Public\\*) AND NOT signature.trusted:true
  - name: "Service Leading to Network Activity"
    query: >
      process.name:(svchost.exe OR rundll32.exe) AND network.direction:outbound AND initiated_by:service

automation_hooks:
  - "Auto-enrich service binary hash with VT/Reputation feed"
  - "Trigger full EDR timeline if service path is suspicious"
  - "Auto-isolate host if known malware service is confirmed"
  - "Alert on lateral spread of service creation"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Always verify if the service binary is signed, known, and in a trusted path."
  - "Flag unknown services with random names or hosted in user-writable directories."
  - "Correlate with any privilege escalation or persistence behavior."
  - "Use service control logs to trace further manipulation attempts."
