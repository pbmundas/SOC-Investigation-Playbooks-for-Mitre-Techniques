playbook_name: "T1531 - Service Modification Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1531"
technique_name: "Modify Existing Service"
description: >
  Detects adversaries modifying existing system services to evade defenses, maintain persistence, or escalate privileges.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Service Configuration Changes"
    description: >
      Track changes to service configurations such as startup type, binary path, and service parameters.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unauthorized modifications to service binaries or configurations?"
      - "Are service startup types changed unexpectedly?"
    data_sources:
      - "System event logs"
      - "Service configuration audit logs"
      - "File integrity monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Unusual Service Executable Changes"
    description: >
      Identify modifications or replacements of service executables, especially if pointing to suspicious binaries.
    checklist:
      - "Are service binaries replaced with non-standard executables?"
      - "Is there an increase in service crashes or failures?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Executable hash comparisons"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Service Changes with Other Malicious Activity"
    description: >
      Investigate any suspicious behavior following service modifications, such as privilege escalation or persistence.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of newly spawned processes or scheduled tasks?"
      - "Are there logins or command executions related to modified services?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring logs"
      - "Audit logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Planned or authorized service changes."
      - "Medium: Unusual but unconfirmed modifications."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious service modifications."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified unauthorized changes with malicious impact."
      - "Medium: Suspicious service changes without full context."
      - "Low: Routine service maintenance."

ioc_types:
  - "Unexpected service startup type changes"
  - "Service executable replacements"
  - "Unauthorized service parameter changes"
