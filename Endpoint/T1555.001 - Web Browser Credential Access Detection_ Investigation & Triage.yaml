playbook_name: "T1555.001 - Web Browser Credential Access Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1555.001"
technique_name: "Web Browser Credential Access"
description: >
  Detect attempts to access or steal credentials stored in web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to Browser Credential Stores"
    description: >
      Detect suspicious file or registry access to browser password databases or credential stores.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unauthorized accesses to files like Chrome's 'Login Data' or Firefox's key4.db?"
      - "Is there registry access related to browser credentials?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access logs"
      - "Registry access logs"
      - "Process monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Execution of Known Tools or Scripts"
    description: >
      Identify tools or scripts that extract browser credentials (e.g., LaZagne, Mimikatz modules).
    checklist:
      - "Are known credential dumping tools executed?"
      - "Are PowerShell or scripts accessing browser credential APIs?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious Activities Post-Access"
    description: >
      Look for signs of lateral movement, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access using stolen browser credentials.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual logins or network activity?"
      - "Is there evidence of privilege escalation or account misuse?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network traffic logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate browser sync or backup activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access without confirmed dump."
      - "High: Confirmed extraction of browser credentials."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known tool execution or suspicious process behavior."
      - "Medium: Abnormal file or registry access."
      - "Low: Potential false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to browser credential files or registry"
  - "Execution of credential dumping tools"
  - "Suspicious process or script activity"

queries/examples:

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized access to browser credential stores."
  - "Block execution of known credential dumping tools."
  - "Initiate incident response on confirmed extraction attempts."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if activity aligns with user behavior."
  - "Investigate lateral movement or exfiltration indicators."
  - "Contain affected endpoints and reset credentials as needed."
