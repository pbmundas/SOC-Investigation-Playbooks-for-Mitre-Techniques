technique_name: "Spearphishing via Link"
description: >
  This playbook guides SOC analysts through detecting and investigating spearphishing attempts
  using malicious or compromised links in emails. It covers email analysis, URL inspection,
  user activity correlation, and containment procedures.

detection_sources:
  - Email Gateway Logs (e.g., Microsoft Defender ATP, Proofpoint, Mimecast)
  - Web Proxy and DNS Logs
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  - SIEM Alerts on suspicious URL clicks
  - Threat Intelligence Platforms

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Suspicious Links in Email"
    description: >
      Analyze email metadata and contents to identify suspicious or known malicious URLs.
    checklist:
      - "Verify sender's email domain and reputation"
      - "Extract URLs from email body and headers"
      - "Check URLs against threat intelligence and URL reputation services"
      - "Identify obfuscated or shortened URLs"
    data_sources:
      - "Email logs"
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"
      - "Email content scanning tools"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Web Proxy and DNS Logs"
    description: >
      Review proxy and DNS logs for user clicks on suspicious URLs and domain lookups.
    checklist:
      - "Identify access to malicious or suspicious domains"
      - "Correlate URL clicks with user and endpoint"
      - "Look for repeated or lateral access attempts"
    data_sources:
      - "Web proxy logs"
      - "DNS query logs"
      - "User behavior analytics (UBA/UEBA)"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Endpoint Activity Correlation"
    description: >
      Check for any follow-up malicious activity on endpoints after link clicks.
    checklist:
      - "Review process creation logs for abnormal processes"
      - "Check for downloaded payloads or scripts"
      - "Monitor network connections to suspicious IPs"
      - "Correlate with EDR alerts"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR telemetry"
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "Network flow data"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Containment and Mitigation"
    description: >
      Act to prevent further access or exploitation via the malicious link.
    checklist:
      - "Block malicious URLs and domains at proxy and email gateway"
      - "Quarantine affected emails"
      - "Isolate infected hosts"
      - "Reset user credentials if compromise is suspected"
    data_sources:
      - "Network security controls"
      - "Email gateway management"
      - "Endpoint management systems"

  - step_number: 5
    title: "User Awareness and Reporting"
    description: >
      Notify and educate users about the spearphishing attempt.
    checklist:
      - "Send awareness communications to impacted users"
      - "Provide guidance on identifying suspicious links"
      - "Encourage reporting of suspicious emails or clicks"
    data_sources:
      - "Security awareness platforms"
      - "Internal communication tools"

triage_labels:
  - severity:
      - "Low: Suspicious URL identified, no user interaction"
      - "Medium: User clicked link, no malicious payload detected"
      - "High: Confirmed payload download or endpoint compromise"
  - confidence:
      - "High: Known malicious URL or confirmed exploitation"
      - "Medium: Suspicious URL or behavior"
      - "Low: Potential false positive"

ioc_types:
  - Email Address
  - Sender Domain
  - URL
  - Domain Name
  - IP Address

example_queries:
  - name: "Suspicious URLs in Emails"
    query: >
      email_body_urls: ("phishingsite.com" OR "maliciousdomain.net" OR "short.url")
  - name: "User Clicks on Malicious URLs"
    query: >
      proxy_logs.url: ("phishingsite.com" OR "maliciousdomain.net") AND user_id: *
  - name: "Endpoint Execution After URL Click"
    query: >
      event_type=process_creation AND
      (process_name="powershell.exe" OR process_name="cmd.exe") AND
      user IN (SELECT user FROM proxy_logs WHERE url IN ("phishingsite.com", "maliciousdomain.net"))

automation_hooks:
  - "Block malicious URLs in proxy and email gateways"
  - "Generate alerts for suspicious URL clicks"
  - "Trigger endpoint scans and isolate compromised hosts"
  - "Create tickets for analyst review"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Focus on URLs with poor reputation or those flagged by threat intelligence"
  - "Correlate email, network, and endpoint logs to confirm impact"
  - "Prioritize rapid containment for high-severity incidents"
  - "Engage users to gather context and report suspicious activity"
