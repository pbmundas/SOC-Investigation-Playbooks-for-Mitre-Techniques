playbook_name: "T1120 - Peripheral Device Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1120"
technique_name: "Peripheral Device Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries attempting to gather information on peripheral devices connected to systems to identify potential vectors for data theft or further compromise.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Enumeration of Connected Devices"
    description: >
      Monitor execution of commands or utilities that enumerate peripheral devices (e.g., 'lsusb', 'Get-PnpDevice', device manager queries).
    checklist:
      - "Are enumeration commands executed by suspicious accounts?"
      - "Is peripheral discovery occurring outside of normal maintenance windows?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command line auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor File and Registry Access for Device Information"
    description: >
      Identify access to system files or registry keys storing device details.
    checklist:
      - "Are device-related files or registry paths accessed unexpectedly?"
      - "Is access linked to unauthorized processes or users?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Registry access logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Peripheral Discovery with Suspicious Activities"
    description: >
      Review for subsequent actions such as data copying to removable media or installation of drivers.
    checklist:
      - "Is there increased USB device activity following discovery?"
      - "Are there new device drivers installed or loaded?"
    data_sources:
      - "USB device logs"
      - "Driver installation logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized device enumeration."
      - "Medium: Discovery during off-hours or by non-admins."
      - "High: Discovery preceding data exfiltration or malware deployment."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed enumeration commands/processes."
      - "Medium: Suspicious file or registry access."
      - "Low: Normal administrative activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of peripheral enumeration utilities"
  - "Access to device registry keys or driver files"
  - "Unusual USB device mounts or usage"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Peripheral Enumeration Commands"
    query: >
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)(lsusb|Get-PnpDevice|Get-WmiObject Win32_USBControllerDevice)"

  - name: "Detect Access to USB Registry Keys"
    query: >
      registry.key_path CONTAINS "SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\USB"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized peripheral device enumeration."
  - "Restrict access to device info registry keys."
  - "Monitor USB device activity closely after discovery."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate legitimacy of device discovery activity."
  - "Investigate USB usage and new driver installations."
  - "Recommend policies restricting peripheral device use."
