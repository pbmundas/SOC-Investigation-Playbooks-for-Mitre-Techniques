playbook_name: "T1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol Detection"
tactic: "Exfiltration"
technique_id: "T1048"
technique_name: "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol"
description: >
  Detect data exfiltration using non-standard or less common protocols (FTP, SSH, DNS, ICMP, etc.).

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Unusual Protocol Usage"
    description: >
      Monitor network traffic for use of alternative protocols commonly used for exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Are there spikes in FTP, SSH, DNS tunneling, or ICMP traffic?"
      - "Is protocol use outside normal business hours or to unusual destinations?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network flow logs"
      - "Firewall logs"
      - "DNS logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Payload and Session Characteristics"
    description: >
      Examine sessions for signs of data transfer such as large payloads, encoding, or tunneling.
    checklist:
      - "Are payload sizes larger than expected?"
      - "Is there evidence of DNS tunneling or covert channels?"
    data_sources:
      - "Packet captures"
      - "Network anomaly detection tools"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Endpoint and Process Activity"
    description: >
      Investigate processes involved in alternative protocol communications.
    checklist:
      - "Are there processes that initiated connections using alternative protocols?"
      - "Are file access or staging activities correlated?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR logs"
      - "Process monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Expected use of alternative protocols."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or anomalous activity."
      - "High: Confirmed data exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed exfiltration."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Unusual protocol connections"
  - "Encoded or tunneled data"
  - "Suspicious endpoint process activity"

  - name: "Detect Large FTP Uploads"
    query: >
