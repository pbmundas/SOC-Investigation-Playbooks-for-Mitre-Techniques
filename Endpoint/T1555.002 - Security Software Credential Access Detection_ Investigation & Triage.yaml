playbook_name: "T1555.002 - Security Software Credential Access Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1555.002"
technique_name: "Security Software Credential Access"
description: >
  Detect attempts to access credentials stored by security software such as antivirus, EDR, or other security solutions.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to Security Software Credential Stores"
    description: >
      Detect suspicious file or registry access to credential stores used by security software.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unauthorized reads of credential stores or config files of security tools?"
      - "Is there unusual process access to security product directories?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access logs"
      - "Registry monitoring"
      - "Process monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Known Tools or Scripts"
    description: >
      Identify tools or malware targeting security software credentials for privilege escalation or evasion.
    checklist:
      - "Are known attacker tools or custom scripts detected?"
      - "Is there evidence of privilege escalation attempts post credential access?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Security Evasion or Privilege Escalation"
    description: >
      Look for subsequent suspicious behavior like disabling security controls or elevating privileges.
    checklist:
      - "Are there changes to security configurations?"
      - "Is there evidence of security product tampering?"
    data_sources:
      - "Configuration change logs"
      - "Endpoint security logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Routine maintenance or authorized activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access without further action."
      - "High: Confirmed credential theft and security product tampering."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known tool execution or suspicious behavior."
      - "Medium: Abnormal access patterns."
      - "Low: Possible false alarms."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to security software credential files"
  - "Execution of credential dumping or escalation tools"
  - "Security product configuration changes"
