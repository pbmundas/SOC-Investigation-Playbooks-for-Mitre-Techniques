playbook_name: "TA0005 - Disabling or Modifying Cloud Defenses in AWS: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "TA0005"
technique_name: "Defense Evasion"
description: >
  Detect and respond to adversaries attempting to disable or modify AWS security services such as GuardDuty, AWS Config, CloudTrail, or Security Hub to avoid detection.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Service Modification or Disablement Events"
    description: >
      Monitor CloudTrail for API calls like StopMonitoringMembers, DeleteTrail, StopLogging, or UpdateDetector.
    checklist:
      - "Is there an API call indicating disabling of logging or monitoring?"
      - "Is the action taken by an unexpected user or role?"
      - "Are there signs of privilege escalation before the action?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail logs"
      - "IAM policy and role change logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate Events with Suspicious Activities"
    description: >
      Look for precursor or follow-up events like credential theft, privilege escalation, or unusual data access.
    checklist:
      - "Was this action preceded by suspicious login behavior or lateral movement?"
      - "Was there new role or key creation before the event?"
      - "Is there any exfiltration attempt following this event?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "SIEM correlation rules"
      - "VPC Flow Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Determine Impact and Scope"
    description: >
      Assess which security services were impacted and whether visibility was lost.
    checklist:
      - "Was logging stopped or configuration deleted?"
      - "Was detection service like GuardDuty or Security Hub disabled?"
      - "Is there a gap in logs for the targeted services?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "Security service dashboards"
      - "S3 bucket access logs (if applicable)"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Misconfigured automation with unintended effects."
      - "Medium: Legitimate admin testing activity."
      - "High: Confirmed attacker disabling defenses."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Disabling commands from compromised or unknown identities."
      - "Medium: Suspicious timing or access context."
      - "Low: Administrative change with documented intent."

ioc_types:
  - "StopLogging or DeleteTrail API call"
  - "UpdateDetector with GuardDuty set to disabled"
  - "Disabling or detaching IAM policies"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect CloudTrail StopLogging Events"
    query: >
      eventName="StopLogging" OR eventName="DeleteTrail"
  - name: "Detect GuardDuty Disabling"
    query: >
      eventName="UpdateDetector" AND requestParameters.enable=false

automation_hooks:
  - "Immediate alert for disabling of CloudTrail, GuardDuty, AWS Config."
  - "Auto-enable CloudTrail or GuardDuty if policy permits."
  - "Trigger containment and identity investigation runbook."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify actor identity and whether the change was authorized."
  - "Restore impacted security services from backup or re-enable."
  - "Review IAM policies and audit logs for further compromise indicators."
