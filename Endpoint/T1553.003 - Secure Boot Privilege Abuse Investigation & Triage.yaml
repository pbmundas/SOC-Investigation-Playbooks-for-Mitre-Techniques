tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1553.003"
technique_name: "Secure Boot Privilege Abuse"
description: >
  Detect attempts to abuse Secure Boot privileges to execute unauthorized or tampered code during system startup.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Modification or Disablement of Secure Boot"
    description: >
      Identify changes to Secure Boot settings or attempts to disable Secure Boot to allow execution of unsigned code.
    checklist:
      - "Are Secure Boot settings altered or disabled?"
      - "Are there firmware configuration changes or tampering events?"
    data_sources:
      - "UEFI firmware logs"
      - "Windows Event Logs (Secure Boot events)"
      - "Endpoint security telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor for Unauthorized Bootloader or Boot Manager Changes"
    description: >
      Detect suspicious modifications or loading of unauthorized bootloaders that could bypass Secure Boot protections.
    checklist:
      - "Are new or unknown bootloaders present on the system?"
      - "Is there evidence of boot manager tampering?"
    data_sources:
      - "Boot Configuration Data (BCD) logs"
      - "Firmware integrity monitoring"
      - "EDR and endpoint logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Privilege Escalation and Persistence"
    description: >
      Link Secure Boot abuse with attempts to gain privileged access or establish persistence.
    checklist:
      - "Are there privilege escalation attempts after Secure Boot modifications?"
      - "Is malware or rootkit persistence observed post-boot?"
    data_sources:
      - "Privilege escalation detection"
      - "Malware detection logs"
      - "SIEM correlation rules"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate or Respond"
    description: >
      Confirm Secure Boot abuse and initiate containment and remediation.
    checklist:
      - "Is Secure Boot configuration restored or system re-imaged?"
      - "Are firmware and boot components integrity validated?"
    data_sources:
      - "Incident response tools"
      - "Firmware validation utilities"
      - "Patch and update management"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Configuration changes without malicious intent."
      - "Medium: Suspicious Secure Boot changes detected."
      - "High: Confirmed Secure Boot abuse with malicious payload."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known Secure Boot abuse indicators."
      - "Medium: Unusual bootloader or firmware modifications."
      - "Low: Inconclusive or uncorroborated events."

ioc_types:
  - "Firmware configuration hashes"
  - "Bootloader filenames and hashes"
  - "Secure Boot event IDs"
  - "UEFI variable changes"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Secure Boot Disablement Events"
    query: >
      event.id: (SecureBootDisableEventIDs) AND event.message:"Secure Boot disabled"
  - name: "Bootloader Modification Detection"
    query: >
      file.name: ("bootmgr", "bootx64.efi") AND file.hash:NOT_IN(known_good_hashes)
  - name: "UEFI Variable Changes"
    query: >
      uefi.variable.name:("SecureBoot") AND uefi.variable.status:"changed"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on Secure Boot disablement or tampering."
  - "Block unauthorized bootloader changes."
  - "Trigger firmware integrity scans and forensic imaging."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review UEFI and Secure Boot logs carefully."
  - "Validate bootloader integrity against known good baselines."
  - "Engage firmware security experts and IR team immediately."
