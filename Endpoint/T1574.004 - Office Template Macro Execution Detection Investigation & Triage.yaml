playbook_name: "T1574.004 - Office Template Macro Execution Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1574.004"
technique_name: "Office Template Macros"
description: >
  Detect and investigate adversaries abusing Microsoft Office templates with embedded macros to achieve persistence or execute malicious code.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Macro-enabled Office Documents"
    description: >
      Detect Office documents (e.g., .docm, .xlsm) with macros, especially those from untrusted sources.
    checklist:
      - "Are macro-enabled documents opened by users?"
      - "Are macros digitally signed or unsigned?"
      - "Is the document origin suspicious (e.g., email attachments, downloads)?"
    data_sources:
      - "Email gateway logs"
      - "File metadata scanning"
      - "Endpoint process creation logs"
      - "Office application logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Macro Execution Events"
    description: >
      Monitor execution of macros or scripts launched by Office applications.
    checklist:
      - "Are there script or command executions triggered by Office apps?"
      - "Are macros executing suspicious system commands or network connections?"
      - "Are PowerShell or cmd processes spawned by Office processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command line audit"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Assess Persistence and Malicious Activity"
    description: >
      Check if macro execution leads to persistence mechanisms or further attacks.
    checklist:
      - "Are payloads dropped or executed post macro execution?"
      - "Is there network communication related to C2 or data exfiltration?"
      - "Are other artifacts such as scheduled tasks or registry changes observed?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Network logs"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate User and Document Context"
    description: >
      Assess legitimacy of macro use based on user role and document trust level.
    checklist:
      - "Is the user authorized to open macro-enabled documents?"
      - "Is the document signed by a trusted publisher?"
      - "Are endpoint protections active and updated?"
    data_sources:
      - "User access logs"
      - "Digital certificate databases"
      - "EDR status"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate macro usage by trusted users."
      - "Medium: Suspicious macro execution without clear impact."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious macro execution with payload delivery."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: IOC matches known macro malware or attacker TTPs."
      - "Medium: Unsigned or obfuscated macros with suspicious behavior."
      - "Low: Benign macro usage or new but unverified macros."

ioc_types:
  - "Macro-enabled Office document hashes"
  - "Process parent-child relationships (Office app to cmd/PowerShell)"
  - "Command line arguments executed by macros"
  - "Email sender addresses or file download sources"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Macro-enabled Document Execution"
    query: >
      file.extension:("docm" OR "xlsm") AND event.action:"file_opened"
  - name: "Office Processes Launching PowerShell or Cmd"
    query: >
      process.parent.name:("winword.exe" OR "excel.exe") AND
      process.name:("powershell.exe" OR "cmd.exe") AND
      process.command_line:("*-EncodedCommand*" OR "*Invoke-*")
  - name: "Suspicious Macro Execution with Network Activity"
    query: >
      process.name:("winword.exe" OR "excel.exe") AND
      network.connection:* AND
      process.command_line:("*Invoke-WebRequest*" OR "*DownloadString*")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unsigned macro execution in Office apps"
  - "Block execution of macros from untrusted sources"
  - "Quarantine suspicious Office documents"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify document origin and signature."
  - "Check parent-child processes for suspicious spawning."
  - "Correlate with network and file system activity."
  - "Use threat intelligence for known macro malware hashes."
