playbook_name: "T1218 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1218"
technique_name: "Signed Binary Proxy Execution"
description: >
  Detect abuse of signed, trusted binaries to proxy execution of malicious code, evading detection by security products.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Suspicious Use of Signed Binaries"
    description: >
      Monitor for unusual or unauthorized execution of signed system binaries (e.g., rundll32.exe, regsvr32.exe, mshta.exe).
    checklist:
      - "Are signed binaries executing unexpected scripts or commands?"
      - "Are binaries invoked by unusual users or processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command line arguments"
      - "Code signing logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Known Proxy Execution Techniques"
    description: >
      Detect command lines or scripts that use signed binaries to execute payloads, e.g., regsvr32 running .sct scripts.
    checklist:
      - "Are signed binaries used to execute remote scripts or payloads?"
      - "Is there evidence of persistence or lateral movement via these binaries?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Network logs"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Threat Intelligence"
    description: >
      Cross-reference with known indicators, hashes, or campaigns abusing signed binaries.
    checklist:
      - "Are suspicious binaries or hashes listed in threat intel feeds?"
      - "Is attack pattern consistent with known campaigns?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence platforms"
      - "SIEM"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Incident Response"
    description: >
      Block or isolate affected hosts, remove malicious payloads, and harden execution policies.
    checklist:
      - "Quarantine affected hosts."
      - "Update endpoint policies to restrict misuse."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management tools"
      - "Incident response platforms"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized use of signed binaries."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or unexpected usage."
      - "High: Confirmed abuse of signed binaries for malicious activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed malicious use."
      - "Medium: Indicators suspicious but inconclusive."
      - "Low: Legitimate usage."

ioc_types:
  - "Process command lines invoking signed binaries with suspicious arguments"
  - "Hashes of known malicious scripts or payloads"
  - "Unusual parent-child process relationships involving signed binaries"

queries/examples:
  - name: "regsvr32 executing remote script"
    query: >
      process.command_line:*regsvr32*.*.sct
  - name: "rundll32 executing suspicious payload"
    query: >
      process.command_line:*rundll32* AND NOT process.parent_image:rundll32.exe

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unusual command lines invoking signed binaries."
  - "Trigger threat intel enrichment and analyst review."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify legitimacy of signed binary executions."
  - "Check related network or file system activity."
  - "Engage incident response if abuse suspected."
