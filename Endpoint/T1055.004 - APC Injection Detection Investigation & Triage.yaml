playbook_name: "T1055.004 - APC Injection Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1055.004"
technique_name: "APC Injection"
description: >
  Detect Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC) injection used by adversaries to queue code execution in the context of another thread.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor APC Queueing Behavior"
    description: >
      Detect use of QueueUserAPC targeting remote threads.
    checklist:
      - "Are threads in remote processes being targeted by APCs?"
      - "Are APCs queuing suspicious shellcode or module loads?"
    data_sources:
      - "API telemetry"
      - "Thread injection logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Track Execution Flow from APCs"
    description: >
      Monitor for execution initiated from APC routines in unusual memory regions.
    checklist:
      - "Is code executing from heap or injected memory?"
      - "Are legitimate processes exhibiting suspicious behavior post-APC?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR"
      - "Memory analysis"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Indicators of Malicious Activity"
    description: >
      Combine APC usage data with known malware behavior and tools.
    checklist:
      - "Does the process match malware profiles?"
      - "Are persistence mechanisms observed alongside?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM alerts"
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate and Contain"
    description: >
      Confirm malicious APC injection and initiate containment.
    checklist:
      - "Is APC origin suspicious or undocumented?"
      - "Is memory capture or live response needed?"
    data_sources:
      - "IR response tools"
      - "Memory forensics"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Benign APCs by normal apps."
      - "Medium: Unusual APCs in critical processes."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious APC injection."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known tools using APC injection."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unverified sequences."
      - "Low: Isolated or rare APC usage."

ioc_types:
  - "Thread context targets"
  - "QueueUserAPC calls"
  - "Unusual memory execution paths"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on remote APCs."
  - "Trigger memory snapshot if injection suspected."
  - "Isolate host for deeper analysis."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Trace APCs back to originating code."
  - "Capture volatile memory."
  - "Escalate for containment if confirmed malicious."
