tactic: "Privilege Escalation"
technique_id: "T1548.001"
technique_name: "Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Sudo and Sudo Caching"
description: >
  Detect and investigate abuse of sudo privileges on Linux/Unix systems for unauthorized privilege escalation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Sudo Usage and Command Execution"
    description: >
      Monitor and analyze sudo command execution events.
    checklist:
      - "Was sudo used with suspicious or uncommon commands?"
      - "Was sudo access granted without password due to sudoers misconfiguration?"
    data_sources:
      - "Auditd logs (/var/log/audit/audit.log)"
      - "Syslog (/var/log/auth.log)"
      - "EDR agent telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate with User and Process Context"
    description: >
      Identify the initiating user and process context.
    checklist:
      - "Is the user authorized to perform sudo actions?"
      - "Was the process launched interactively or through a script?"
    data_sources:
      - "User session logs"
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Linux EDR"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Review Sudoers Configuration"
    description: >
      Examine the sudoers file and access policies.
    checklist:
      - "Are NOPASSWD entries configured?"
      - "Are any scripts or binaries given root access via sudo?"
    data_sources:
      - "/etc/sudoers"
      - "/etc/sudoers.d/*"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Contain"
    description: >
      Isolate and respond to confirmed misuse.
    checklist:
      - "Should sudo privileges be revoked temporarily?"
      - "Is additional investigation or containment needed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Incident response logs"
      - "IAM tools"
      - "EDR actions"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Expected sudo use."
      - "Medium: Unusual sudo command or misconfiguration."
      - "High: Confirmed abuse of sudo for privilege escalation."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known sudo abuse pattern."
      - "Medium: Unusual but unconfirmed sudo use."
      - "Low: False positive or benign."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious sudo commands"
  - "Usernames with unexpected sudo activity"
  - "Processes launched via sudo"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Sudo Execution Detection"
    query: >
      sudo OR "COMMAND=" OR "sudoers" in /var/log/auth.log OR audit.log

  - name: "NOPASSWD Sudoers Entries"
    query: >
      grep NOPASSWD /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*

automation_hooks:
  - "Trigger alert for new or unusual sudo command usage."
  - "Notify on changes to sudoers files."
  - "Auto-isolate systems with confirmed misuse."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm intent and context of sudo use."
  - "Check for persistence mechanisms or lateral movement."
  - "Limit or revoke sudo access as needed."
