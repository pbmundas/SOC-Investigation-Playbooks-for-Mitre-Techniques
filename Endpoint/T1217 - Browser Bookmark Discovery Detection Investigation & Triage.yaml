playbook_name: "T1217 - Browser Bookmark Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1217"
technique_name: "Browser Bookmark Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries searching browser bookmark files or data to gather information about frequently visited sites, credentials, or targets for further exploitation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to Browser Bookmark Files"
    description: >
      Identify file access or reading of common browser bookmark files such as Chrome's `Bookmarks` file or Firefox's `places.sqlite`.
    checklist:
      - "Are bookmark files accessed or copied unexpectedly?"
      - "Is access performed by non-standard or suspicious processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Process activity logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Processes Reading or Exporting Bookmark Data"
    description: >
      Detect tools or scripts that extract or export browser bookmark data.
    checklist:
      - "Are known extraction tools or custom scripts running?"
      - "Are exports of bookmark files sent externally?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs"
      - "Network monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Bookmark Discovery with Other Reconnaissance or Credential Access Activities"
    description: >
      Investigate if bookmark discovery coincides with credential theft, phishing attempts, or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Are there suspicious login attempts on sites found in bookmarks?"
      - "Is data exfiltration detected after bookmark access?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network data loss prevention logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Bookmark access by authorized users or browsers."
      - "Medium: Access by scripts or non-browser processes."
      - "High: Access linked to credential theft or reconnaissance."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized bookmark access."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access without full context."
      - "Low: Normal user activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to Chrome Bookmarks file or Firefox places.sqlite"
  - "Execution of bookmark extraction tools"
  - "Unusual processes reading browser data"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Access to Chrome Bookmarks File"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized access to bookmark files."
  - "Block suspicious processes accessing browser data."
  - "Monitor outbound traffic for bookmark data exfiltration."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if bookmark access is legitimate."
  - "Check for signs of credential theft or phishing."
  - "Recommend restricting access to browser profile directories."
