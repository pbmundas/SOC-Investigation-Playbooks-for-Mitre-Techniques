tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1136.002"
technique_name: "Domain Group Discovery"
description: >
  Detects reconnaissance attempts where adversaries enumerate domain groups to identify targets
  for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

detection_sources:
  - Active Directory logs
  - Windows Security Event Logs (EventID 4728, 4729, 4732, 4733)
  - LDAP query logs
  - SIEM alerts on group enumeration activity

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Domain Group Enumeration"
    description: >
      Monitor for events and logs showing enumeration of domain groups.
    checklist:
      - "Check EventID 4728 (member added to global group) and 4729 (member removed)"
      - "Monitor EventID 4732, 4733 for local group membership changes"
      - "Analyze LDAP query logs for group enumeration"
      - "Identify unusual frequency or accounts performing enumeration"
    data_sources:
      - "Active Directory Security logs"
      - "LDAP logs"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Accounts Performing Enumeration"
    description: >
      Investigate accounts enumerating domain groups.
    checklist:
      - "Validate if accounts are privileged or service accounts"
      - "Check for anomalous login times and locations"
      - "Review historical behavior and recent changes"
    data_sources:
      - "User account activity logs"
      - "UEBA alerts"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Response and Containment"
    description: >
      Limit reconnaissance and potential escalation.
    checklist:
      - "Restrict suspicious accounts"
      - "Apply conditional access policies"
      - "Monitor ongoing activity closely"
    data_sources:
      - "Identity management systems"
      - "Access control logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity:
      - "Low: Single event or low frequency"
      - "Medium: Multiple events from non-admin accounts"
      - "High: High frequency or from compromised accounts"
  - confidence:
      - "High: Clear enumeration activity"
      - "Medium: Suspicious but inconclusive"
      - "Low: Normal admin activity"
