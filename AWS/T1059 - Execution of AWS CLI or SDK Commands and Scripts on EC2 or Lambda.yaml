tactic: "Execution"
technique_id: "T1059"

description: >
  Detect and investigate the execution of AWS CLI or SDK commands, scripts, or automated jobs
  running on EC2 instances or Lambda functions, especially those used to collect data or perform unauthorized access.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Execution of AWS CLI or SDK Commands on EC2 or Lambda"
    description: >
      Monitor command execution on EC2 instances and Lambda function invocations that utilize AWS CLI or SDK calls.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual AWS CLI commands or SDK invocations from EC2 or Lambda?"
      - "Is command execution occurring outside of scheduled or approved automation?"
      - "Are credentials or tokens being used unusually during these executions?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "EC2 System and Application Logs"
      - "Lambda Execution Logs"
      - "CloudWatch Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Scripts in Lambda or EC2 for Data Collection"
    description: >
      Investigate scripts running within Lambda or EC2 designed to collect sensitive data or perform reconnaissance.
    checklist:
      - "Are scripts accessing or exporting data from AWS resources?"
      - "Are Lambda functions or EC2 scripts querying S3, DynamoDB, or RDS beyond normal usage?"
      - "Is there evidence of data exfiltration or unusual data movement?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "S3 Access Logs"
      - "DynamoDB and RDS Audit Logs"
      - "Lambda and EC2 Application Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Investigate Access Patterns to S3, DynamoDB, and RDS"
    description: >
      Monitor access to critical AWS data stores for unusual or unauthorized read/write operations initiated by EC2 or Lambda.
    checklist:
      - "Are there access attempts to S3 buckets or DynamoDB tables from unexpected EC2 or Lambda resources?"
      - "Are permissions escalated or modified to enable data access?"
      - "Is there unusual volume or pattern of database queries?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "S3 Server Access Logs"
      - "DynamoDB Streams and Logs"
      - "RDS Audit Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal scripted automation with proper authorization."
      - "Medium: Unusual command or data access patterns."
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized data collection or exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Correlated events showing malicious execution and data access."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but incomplete evidence."
      - "Low: Routine operational activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of AWS CLI or SDK commands from EC2 or Lambda"
  - "Scripts accessing sensitive AWS data services"
  - "Unusual access to S3, DynamoDB, or RDS resources"
