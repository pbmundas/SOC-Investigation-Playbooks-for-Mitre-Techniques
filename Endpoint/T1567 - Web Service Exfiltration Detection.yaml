playbook_name: "T1567 - Web Service Exfiltration Detection"
tactic: "Exfiltration"
technique_id: "T1567"
technique_name: "Exfiltration Over Web Service"
description: >
  Detect adversaries using legitimate web services (e.g., cloud storage, social media) to exfiltrate data.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Traffic to Web Services"
    description: >
      Identify traffic to common web services used for exfiltration (Dropbox, Google Drive, AWS S3, etc.).
    checklist:
      - "Are there large or frequent uploads to web services?"
      - "Is traffic occurring outside normal business hours?"
      - "Are there connections to uncommon or suspicious web services?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Proxy logs"
      - "Cloud access logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Endpoint Activity"
    description: >
      Correlate network activity with file system and process logs.
    checklist:
      - "Are files staged for upload locally?"
      - "Are there suspicious processes interacting with web services?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Review Web Service Account Activity"
    description: >
      Check for unusual usage patterns on the web service accounts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there login anomalies?"
      - "Is there creation of new or unusual folders/buckets?"
      - "Are there permission changes or API token usage?"
    data_sources:
      - "Cloud service logs"
      - "SIEM alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal business uploads."
      - "Medium: Suspicious upload activity."
      - "High: Confirmed exfiltration via web service."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed via logs or IOC."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Unusual upload patterns"
  - "Suspicious endpoints or processes"
  - "Anomalies in cloud account usage"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Large Uploads to Cloud Storage"
    query: >
      network.destination IN known_cloud_storage AND
      network.upload_bytes > threshold

  - name: "Detect New Folder or Bucket Creation"
    query: >
      cloud_service.event_type = "CreateFolder" OR "CreateBucket" AND
      user NOT IN known_admins

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious web service uploads."
  - "Investigate endpoint and cloud account activity."
  - "Coordinate with cloud security teams."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if web service use is authorized."
  - "Review data types and exfiltration scope."
  - "Initiate incident response if malicious."
