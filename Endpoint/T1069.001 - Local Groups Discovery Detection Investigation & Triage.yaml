playbook_name: "T1069.001 - Local Groups Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1069.001"
technique_name: "Local Groups Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries enumerating local groups on a system to identify user privileges and potential targets for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Local Group Enumeration Commands"
    description: >
      Identify use of commands such as `net localgroup`, `Get-LocalGroup`, or PowerShell scripts enumerating local group memberships.
    checklist:
      - "Are local group enumeration commands executed?"
      - "Are these actions performed by unauthorized or unusual accounts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line auditing"
      - "Endpoint logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Unusual Local Group Enumeration Patterns"
    description: >
      Look for frequent or broad local group enumeration activity, especially by non-admin users.
    checklist:
      - "Is local group enumeration performed outside normal hours?"
      - "Is there enumeration of multiple local groups in a short time frame?"
    data_sources:
      - "User activity logs"
      - "Endpoint monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Local Group Discovery with Malicious Activity"
    description: >
      Determine if local group discovery is followed by privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there subsequent privilege escalation or suspicious logins?"
      - "Is local admin group membership targeted?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Endpoint detection system logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Local group enumeration by authorized personnel."
      - "Medium: Enumeration by non-admin or suspicious accounts."
      - "High: Discovery linked to privilege abuse or lateral movement."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized local group enumeration."
      - "Medium: Suspicious enumeration activity."
      - "Low: Routine system audits."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of `net localgroup` command"
  - "PowerShell cmdlets like `Get-LocalGroup`"
  - "Enumeration from suspicious users or processes"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect net localgroup Command"
    query: >
      process.name == "net.exe" AND
      process.command_line CONTAINS "localgroup"

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Get-LocalGroup Usage"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-LocalGroup"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized local group enumeration."
  - "Restrict access to local group enumeration commands."
  - "Investigate subsequent suspicious activity."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate intent and legitimacy of local group queries."
  - "Correlate with privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts."
  - "Recommend restricting local group enumeration to admins."
