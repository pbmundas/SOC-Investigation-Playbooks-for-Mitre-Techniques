playbook_name: "T1564.002 - Hidden User Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1564.002"
technique_name: "Hidden User"
description: >
  Detect adversaries creating or manipulating user accounts to hide them from standard enumeration and maintain stealth access.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Enumerate and Compare User Accounts"
    description: >
      Perform detailed user account enumeration using multiple methods to detect discrepancies or hidden accounts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there users missing from standard GUI or cmd enumeration?"
      - "Are accounts hidden by flags, disabled status, or ACL manipulation?"
      - "Is there a difference between local and domain user listings?"
    data_sources:
      - "Local and domain user enumeration tools"
      - "Active Directory logs"
      - "Audit and security logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Inspect User Account Attributes and ACLs"
    description: >
      Examine user account properties and permissions that might conceal the account.
    checklist:
      - "Does the account have unusual attributes or permissions?"
      - "Is the account marked as hidden or system?"
      - "Are there anomalies in account creation/modification logs?"
    data_sources:
      - "AD attribute logs"
      - "Security event logs"
      - "Configuration management systems"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Hidden Users with Suspicious Activities"
    description: >
      Link hidden accounts with suspicious logins, privilege escalations, or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Is there suspicious activity from hidden accounts?"
      - "Are hidden users part of persistence or privilege escalation?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "SIEM correlation alerts"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Contain and Remediate"
    description: >
      Disable or remove unauthorized hidden users and improve monitoring.
    checklist:
      - "Disable or delete unauthorized hidden accounts."
      - "Harden account enumeration and monitoring policies."
    data_sources:
      - "Identity and access management systems"
      - "Incident response tools"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate hidden/system accounts."
      - "Medium: Suspicious hidden user accounts."
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized hidden users."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Strong evidence of malicious hidden user."
      - "Medium: Possible anomaly needing further review."
      - "Low: Known benign hidden accounts."

ioc_types:
  - "User accounts with hidden or system flags"
  - "Disabled but active accounts"
  - "Discrepancies in user enumeration results"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect hidden or disabled user accounts"

      user.account.hidden:true OR user.account.disabled:true OR user.account.system:true

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on new hidden or disabled accounts created."
  - "Trigger investigation on enumeration discrepancies."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify user legitimacy via HR or system owners."
  - "Check user account creation and modification logs."
  - "Correlate account activity with suspicious behavior."
