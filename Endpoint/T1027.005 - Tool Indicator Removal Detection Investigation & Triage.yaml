playbook_name: "T1027.005 - Tool Indicator Removal Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1027.005"
technique_name: "Indicator Removal on Tools"
description: >
  Detect adversaries removing or tampering with indicators on their tools to evade detection.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Altered or Tampered Tools"
    description: >
      Detect changes to tool binaries or removal of identifying metadata.
    checklist:
      - "Are tool file hashes differing from known baseline?"
      - "Are digital signatures missing or invalid?"
    data_sources:
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "Code signing logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor Tool Behavior for Evasion"
    description: >
      Detect suspicious tool behavior inconsistent with original versions.
    checklist:
      - "Are tools modifying logs, artifacts, or security products?"
      - "Is there evidence of tool self-modification?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process behavior logs"
      - "Security monitoring logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Evasion Techniques"
    description: >
      Investigate if indicator removal is part of broader defense evasion.
    checklist:
      - "Are indicators removed in conjunction with log clearing or artifact removal?"
      - "Is the tool execution linked with other suspicious activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "SIEM correlations"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Tools updated or patched legitimately."
      - "Medium: Tools with altered metadata but no malicious activity."
      - "High: Tools tampered for malicious evasion."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Hash mismatches and suspicious behavior."
      - "Medium: Metadata changes only."
      - "Low: False positives from legitimate updates."

ioc_types:
  - "Altered tool hashes"
  - "Missing or invalid signatures"
  - "Unusual tool behavior or modifications"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Tool Hash Mismatches"
    query: >
      file.name:("tool.exe" OR "sysmon.exe") AND NOT file.hash:known_hashes
  - name: "Detect Missing Signatures"
    query: >
      file.signature:missing AND file.name:("tool.exe")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on hash mismatches for critical tools."
  - "Block execution of tampered tools if possible."
  - "Trigger forensic analysis on altered tools."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if tool updates are authorized."
  - "Analyze behavioral differences from original tools."
  - "Investigate linked events for malicious activity."
