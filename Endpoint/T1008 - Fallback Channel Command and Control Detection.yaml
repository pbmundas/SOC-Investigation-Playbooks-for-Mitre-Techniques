playbook_name: "T1008 - Fallback Channel Command and Control Detection"
tactic: "Command and Control"
technique_id: "T1008"
technique_name: "Fallback Channel"
description: >
  Detect adversaries using fallback communication channels for command and control if primary channels are unavailable.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor for Secondary or Unusual Communication Channels"
    description: >
      Identify communications over less common ports, protocols, or services that may be fallback C2 channels.
    checklist:
      - "Are endpoints communicating on unusual ports or protocols?"
      - "Is there communication to rarely used external IPs/domains?"
      - "Are there sudden shifts in network traffic patterns?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network flow logs"
      - "Firewall and proxy logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate with Primary C2 Channel Status"
    description: >
      Check if the primary C2 channel was disrupted prior to fallback communication.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of blocking or interruption of normal C2?"
      - "Are fallback channels initiated soon after primary channel failures?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network security device logs"
      - "Incident response reports"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Investigate Endpoint and Process Activity"
    description: >
      Analyze endpoint activity for tools or processes initiating fallback communication.
    checklist:
      - "Are there suspicious processes initiating network connections?"
      - "Is there abnormal process spawning correlated with fallback communication?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "EDR telemetry"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate alternate communications."
      - "Medium: Suspicious fallback communications."
      - "High: Confirmed fallback channel C2."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Behavioral or IOC match."
      - "Medium: Anomalies without full context."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Communication over unusual ports/protocols"
  - "Known fallback C2 IPs/domains"
  - "Process/network correlations"
