playbook_name: "T1548.001 - Abuse of EC2 Sudo Privileges or Container Root Escalation"
tactic: "Privilege Escalation"
technique_id: "T1548.001"
technique_name: "Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Sudo and Root Access Abuse"
description: >
  Detect and investigate abuse of sudo or root privileges within EC2 instances or containers,
  often used for lateral movement or persistence once initial access is gained.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Unusual Sudo Access by Non-Admin Identities"
    description: >
      Investigate commands executed with `sudo`, particularly those run by users who are not part of typical admin groups.
    checklist:
      - "Is the user a member of the 'sudo' or 'admin' group?"
      - "Are commands like `chmod`, `chown`, `adduser`, or `apt` used with sudo?"
      - "Are there audit entries for `sudo` not tied to known maintenance events?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail (SSM Session Manager command logs)"
      - "EC2 CloudWatch Logs"
      - "Linux auditd (execve and user commands)"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor Root-Level Container Escalations"
    description: >
      Track the execution of privileged containers, host mounts, and attempts to escalate within containerized environments.
    checklist:
      - "Are containers launched with `--privileged` or `--cap-add=ALL`?"
      - "Are host volumes mounted (`/etc`, `/var/run/docker.sock`)?"
      - "Are user IDs inside containers mapping to root (uid 0)?"
    data_sources:
      - "Docker daemon logs"
      - "Kubernetes audit logs (if applicable)"
      - "Falco/OSSEC container rules"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal sudo use during patch cycles."
      - "Medium: Unexpected sudo by dev user or root container instantiation."
      - "High: Confirmed root escalation used to modify IAM or persistence methods."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Escalation confirmed with root-level audit logs."
      - "Medium: Privileged command run by unknown session."
      - "Low: Sudo usage with no obvious escalation."

ioc_types:
  - "Use of `sudo` with non-admin accounts"
  - "`docker run --privileged` or `--cap-add=ALL` executions"
  - "Host volume mounts in containers"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Suspicious Sudo Commands"

  - name: "Privileged Container Detection"
    query: >
      docker logs: docker run --privileged OR --cap-add=ALL
  - name: "Root Container Access"

automation_hooks:
  - "Auto-alert on non-admin sudo usage."
  - "Trigger EDR or forensic snapshot of EC2/container on root escalation."
  - "Initiate IAM permission change detection if root session persists."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate user role/group and justify elevated command."
  - "Cross-reference EC2 or container image and user baseline."
  - "Review cloud hardening and sudoers policy for drift."
