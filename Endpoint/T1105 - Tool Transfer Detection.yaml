playbook_name: "T1105 - Tool Transfer Detection"
tactic: "Command and Control"
technique_id: "T1105"
technique_name: "Ingress Tool Transfer"
description: >
  Detect adversaries transferring tools or files into a compromised environment.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor File Transfer Protocols and Channels"
    description: >
      Identify file transfers using FTP, HTTP, SMB, or other protocols into endpoints.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected or large file downloads?"
      - "Is there usage of uncommon or unauthorized transfer protocols?"
      - "Are files transferred from suspicious or known malicious IPs/domains?"
    data_sources:
      - "Proxy logs"
      - "Firewall logs"
      - "Endpoint file creation logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze File Characteristics"
    description: >
      Inspect transferred files for known malicious signatures or anomalous attributes.
    checklist:
      - "Do transferred files match known malware hashes or signatures?"
      - "Are file names or extensions suspicious or unusual?"
      - "Are there new or unexpected executables on the system?"
    data_sources:
      - "Antivirus/EDR logs"
      - "File integrity monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate File Transfer Events with User and Process Activity"
    description: >
      Determine the initiating user/process and validate legitimacy.
    checklist:
      - "Is file transfer initiated by legitimate users or services?"
      - "Are there anomalies in process spawning or privilege escalation?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "Process monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known legitimate transfers."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed transfers."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious tool transfer."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Signature or IOC match."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Potential false positive."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious file hashes"
  - "Malicious IPs/domains"
  - "Unusual file transfer patterns"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Large File Downloads from Untrusted Sources"

  - name: "Detect Creation of New Executables on Endpoint"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate legitimacy of transferred tools."
  - "Check for lateral movement or further payload delivery."
