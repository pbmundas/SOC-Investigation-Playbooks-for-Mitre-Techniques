playbook_name: "T1133 - External Remote Services Access Detection"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1133"
technique_name: "External Remote Services"
description: >
  This playbook helps SOC analysts investigate the use of legitimate remote access services 
  (e.g., RDP, VPN, Citrix, TeamViewer) by unauthorized actors attempting to gain persistent 
  access to internal systems from external networks.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Review Triggered Alert Details"
    description: >
      Start by examining the alert or log that triggered detection of external remote access.
    checklist:
      - "Which external service was accessed (RDP, VPN, etc.)?"
      - "What is the source IP/location?"
      - "Which user account was involved?"
      - "What time was the access attempt?"
    data_sources:
      - "Firewall/VPN logs"
      - "Windows Security Logs (4624, 4625)"
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "EDR connection events"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Validate IP Reputation and Location"
    description: >
      Assess whether the access originated from known, trusted infrastructure or a risky/geolocated IP.
    checklist:
      - "Is the IP part of known infrastructure (VPN gateway, jump host)?"
      - "Does the IP belong to a known VPN provider or anonymizer?"
      - "Is this location consistent with normal user behavior?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"
      - "GeoIP databases"
      - "SIEM enrichment lookup tables"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Authentication with Endpoint Behavior"
    description: >
      Investigate endpoint activity that followed the remote access event.
    checklist:
      - "Was a user session created after the login?"
      - "Were tools like PowerShell, cmd, or file transfers observed?"
      - "Did EDR flag any suspicious processes or behaviors?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR telemetry"
      - "Sysmon"
      - "Windows Event Logs (4624, 4688, etc.)"
      - "RDP logs (RemoteDesktopServices-RdpCoreTS)"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Detect Signs of Persistence"
    description: >
      Identify whether the attacker configured persistence via user accounts, services, or scheduled tasks.
    checklist:
      - "Were new user accounts created?"
      - "Did attacker configure scheduled tasks or run registry modifications?"
      - "Are there abnormal services set to auto-run?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Registry Logs"
      - "Scheduled Task Events (4698)"
      - "Service Creation Events (7045)"
      - "EDR process creation logs"

  - step_number: 5
    title: "Investigate Remote Access Tool Usage"
    description: >
      Look for usage of legitimate tools often used for remote access like AnyDesk, TeamViewer, or RDP over non-standard ports.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of remote access tools installed or executed?"
      - "Was there communication with known C2 domains related to these tools?"
      - "Are there unusual binaries or processes running under user context?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs (Sysmon, EDR)"
      - "DNS logs"
      - "Proxy/web gateway logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized VPN login from new location"
      - "Medium: RDP login with successful authentication and minor anomalies"
      - "High: Remote access from untrusted IP, suspicious endpoint behavior, or unknown tool"
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: RDP or VPN usage followed by persistence methods"
      - "Medium: First-time access from unusual region"
      - "Low: New VPN access but no follow-up activity"

ioc_types:
  - "External IP Address"
  - "User Account"
  - "Remote Access Tool Hash or Name"
  - "RDP Sessions"
  - "Service Names"
  - "Geo-location"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Unusual VPN Login from External IP"
    query: >
      index=network_logs sourcetype="vpn" user=* 
      NOT src_ip IN (trusted_vpn_ranges)
      | stats count by user, src_ip, dest, action

  - name: "RDP Logon Type from External IP"
    query: >
      EventID=4624 AND LogonType=10 AND IpAddress NOT IN trusted_internal_ranges

  - name: "TeamViewer or AnyDesk Execution"
    query: >
      process_name IN ("TeamViewer.exe", "AnyDesk.exe") OR command_line CONTAINS "TeamViewer"

automation_hooks:
  - "Tag IP address using threat intel source (Malicious, Anonymous Proxy, VPN)"
  - "Trigger EDR scan on endpoint after suspicious RDP access"
  - "Auto-isolate host if remote access and persistence indicators are detected"
  - "Enrich alert with known asset/user risk profile"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Correlate remote login with asset type (server vs workstation)"
  - "Review access pattern for frequency and session duration"
  - "Verify MFA was enforced (if applicable)"
  - "Engage IR team if remote tools + persistence overlap is confirmed"
