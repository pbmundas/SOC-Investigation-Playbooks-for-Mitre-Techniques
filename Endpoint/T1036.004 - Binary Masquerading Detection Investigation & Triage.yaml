playbook_name: "T1036.004 - Binary Masquerading Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1036.004"
technique_name: "Binary Masquerading"
description: >
  Detect adversaries masquerading malicious binaries as legitimate binaries by copying or replacing files.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Binary Name Collisions"
    description: >
      Detect binaries named identical or similar to legitimate binaries but located in unusual directories.
    checklist:
      - "Are there duplicate binaries with common system binary names?"
      - "Are binary hashes different from known good versions?"
    data_sources:
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "Threat intelligence"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Verify File Integrity and Signatures"
    description: >
      Compare digital signatures and hashes with baseline known binaries.
    checklist:
      - "Is digital signature invalid or missing?"
      - "Do hashes differ from official binaries?"
    data_sources:
      - "Digital signature logs"
      - "File hash databases"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Monitor Execution and Behavior"
    description: >
      Observe execution patterns, looking for malicious behavior or privilege escalation.
    checklist:
      - "Does the binary spawn unusual child processes?"
      - "Is there suspicious network activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Network telemetry"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Remediate"
    description: >
      Quarantine masqueraded binaries and restore legitimate files.
    checklist:
      - "Remove suspicious binaries."
      - "Alert on binary replacement attempts."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint protection"
      - "SIEM"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate binaries with version mismatches."
      - "Medium: Suspicious masquerading binaries."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious masquerading."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious binaries."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed."
      - "Low: False positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Duplicate binary names"
  - "Invalid or missing digital signatures"
  - "Hash mismatches"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect binaries named as system files outside standard paths"
    query: >
      file.name:("svchost.exe" OR "explorer.exe") AND NOT file.path:"C:\\Windows\\System32"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on binaries replacing system files."
  - "Trigger file integrity verification."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate binary origin and legitimacy."
  - "Investigate associated process behavior."
