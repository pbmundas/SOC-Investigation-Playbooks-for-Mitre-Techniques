playbook_name: "T1552.005 - Abuse of EC2 Instance Metadata Service on Windows"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1552.005"
technique_name: "Unsecured Credentials: Cloud Instance Metadata API"
description: >
  Detect and investigate the abuse of the EC2 instance metadata service from Windows EC2 instances,
  where attackers query the metadata endpoint to retrieve temporary credentials for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Access to EC2 Metadata Service from Windows Instances"
    description: >
      Monitor HTTP requests to the metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254) originating from Windows EC2 instances.
    checklist:
      - "Are there PowerShell, CMD, or other Windows shell commands accessing the metadata endpoint?"
      - "Are unexpected or suspicious processes making network requests to 169.254.169.254?"
      - "Is metadata access correlated with unusual user activity or logins?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Event Logs (Process Creation, Network Connections)"
      - "VPC Flow Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate Metadata Access with IAM API Calls"
    description: >
      Confirm whether temporary credentials retrieved from metadata are used to call AWS APIs.
    checklist:
      - "Is there increased STS AssumeRole or other IAM actions following metadata access?"
      - "Are API calls from Windows instance IPs unusual in volume or type?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "GuardDuty"
      - "Windows Security Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Routine or expected metadata service access."
      - "Medium: Metadata access by unexpected processes or users."
      - "High: Confirmed credential theft and suspicious API activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Metadata access followed by privilege escalation."
      - "Medium: Metadata access without confirmed follow-on abuse."
      - "Low: Known automation or monitoring tool behavior."

ioc_types:
  - "HTTP GET requests to 169.254.169.254 from Windows processes"
  - "Temporary credential use in AWS API calls from EC2 Windows instance IP"
  - "Suspicious PowerShell or CMD scripts accessing metadata"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Metadata Access via PowerShell"
    query: >
      windows_event_logs: EventID=4688 AND ProcessName IN ("powershell.exe", "cmd.exe") AND CommandLine CONTAINS "169.254.169.254"
  - name: "VPC Flow Log Requests to Metadata Service"
    query: >
      vpcflowlogs: dstAddr=169.254.169.254 AND action=ACCEPT AND srcInstanceType=Windows

automation_hooks:
  - "Auto-alert on metadata access from unknown Windows processes."
  - "Trigger session snapshot on suspicious PowerShell execution."
  - "Initiate IAM role usage audit post metadata access."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if metadata access aligns with baseline admin or monitoring activity."
  - "Investigate processes and users executing commands to metadata endpoint."
  - "Correlate with any detected suspicious AWS API calls or IAM role assumptions."
