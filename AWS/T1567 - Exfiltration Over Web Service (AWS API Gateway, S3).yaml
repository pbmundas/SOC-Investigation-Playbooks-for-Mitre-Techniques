playbook_name: "T1567 - Exfiltration Over Web Service (AWS API Gateway, S3)"
tactic: "Exfiltration"
technique_id: "T1567"
technique_name: "Exfiltration Over Web Service"
description: >
  Detect and investigate data exfiltration over web services such as AWS API Gateway, S3 buckets,
  or other cloud-hosted endpoints that attackers may abuse for covert data transfer.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor AWS API Gateway Logs for Unusual Requests"
    description: >
      Analyze API Gateway access logs and CloudTrail for anomalous or high-volume requests indicative of exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Are there API requests from suspicious IPs or geolocations?"
      - "Are there unusually large payloads or repeated request patterns?"
      - "Is there use of uncommon or custom APIs not aligned with business needs?"
    data_sources:
      - "API Gateway Access Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "VPC Flow Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze S3 Access Logs for Large or Frequent PUT Requests"
    description: >
      Identify high-volume or anomalous uploads to S3 buckets possibly used as exfiltration drop points.
    checklist:
      - "Are there bulk data uploads to rarely accessed buckets?"
      - "Are uploads coming from compromised or unexpected identities?"
      - "Are there repeated uploads of similar data patterns?"
    data_sources:
      - "S3 Access Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate API and S3 Activity with Other Attack Indicators"
    description: >
      Cross-check API Gateway and S3 activity with credential misuse, privilege escalation, or persistence indicators.
    checklist:
      - "Is exfiltration activity preceded by privilege escalation?"
      - "Are compromised IAM keys or roles involved?"
      - "Is there lateral movement or command execution activity in parallel?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "IAM Logs"
      - "EDR or Endpoint Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized API or S3 activity with proper context."
      - "Medium: Suspicious exfiltration patterns needing review."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious data exfiltration over web services."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Strong evidence of unauthorized data transfer."
      - "Medium: Anomalous usage with partial indicators."
      - "Low: Routine activity with minor irregularities."

ioc_types:
  - "High-volume or repeated API Gateway calls with large payloads"
  - "Bulk S3 PUT operations to uncommon buckets"
  - "Unauthorized API calls or role use in API Gateway"

queries/examples:
  - name: "API Gateway Large Payload Requests"
    query: >
      api_gateway_logs: payloadSize > 1000000 AND sourceIPAddress NOT IN trusted_ips
  - name: "Suspicious S3 PUT Upload Patterns"
    query: >
      s3_access_logs: eventName="PutObject" AND bucketName NOT IN known_buckets AND objectSize > 10000000
  - name: "Unauthorized API Gateway Usage"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventSource="apigateway.amazonaws.com" AND userIdentity.sessionContext.attributes.mfaAuthenticated = false

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on large or repeated API Gateway requests from untrusted sources."
  - "Trigger IAM role or key revocation upon suspicious exfiltration detection."
  - "Automatically isolate compromised EC2 or Lambda instances."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate whether API or S3 usage aligns with business functions."
  - "Correlate with other suspicious behaviors like credential compromise."
  - "Recommend API Gateway throttling, logging, and tighter access controls."
