playbook_name: "T1021.004 - SSH Remote Service Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Lateral Movement"
technique_id: "T1021.004"
technique_name: "SSH Remote Service"
description: >
  Detects adversaries leveraging SSH (Secure Shell) for remote access and lateral movement.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor SSH Connection Attempts"
    description: >
      Track inbound SSH connections and authentication attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there repeated failed login attempts indicating brute force?"
      - "Are successful logins from unusual users or IP addresses?"
    data_sources:
      - "SSH logs"
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network connection logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of SSH Tunneling or Port Forwarding"
    description: >
      Identify suspicious SSH tunnels or port forwarding activities that may indicate data exfiltration or pivoting.
    checklist:
      - "Are there SSH sessions with unusual commands or tunneling flags?"
      - "Is there unexpected traffic routed through SSH tunnels?"
    data_sources:
      - "SSH session logs"
      - "Network flow logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate SSH Sessions with Other Malicious Activities"
    description: >
      Check for lateral movement, privilege escalation, or malware activity following SSH access.
    checklist:
      - "Are there suspicious process creations or file accesses after SSH login?"
      - "Is there unusual network communication following SSH sessions?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process logs"
      - "File system logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized SSH access."
      - "Medium: SSH access from new or unusual sources."
      - "High: Unauthorized or suspicious SSH usage."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized SSH access."
      - "Medium: Suspicious SSH login patterns."
      - "Low: Routine system administration."

ioc_types:
  - "Inbound SSH connections on port 22"
  - "Failed and successful SSH logins"
  - "Unusual SSH tunneling or port forwarding"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect SSH Connections"
