playbook_name: "T1563 - Service Session Hijacking Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1563"
technique_name: "Service Session Hijacking"
description: >
  Detects adversaries hijacking active service sessions to maintain access or escalate privileges without credentials.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Unusual Service Session Activity"
    description: >
      Monitor active service sessions for anomalies such as unexpected disconnections, reconnections, or hijack attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Are service sessions ending or restarting unexpectedly?"
      - "Is there activity from unexpected user accounts within service contexts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Service logs"
      - "Session tracking logs"
      - "Windows event logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Process Injection or Handle Duplication"
    description: >
      Identify attempts to inject into or hijack service processes or sessions.
    checklist:
      - "Are there suspicious DLL injections or remote thread creations in service processes?"
      - "Is there evidence of duplicated handles or token impersonation?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection logs"
      - "Process monitoring logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Session Hijacking with Malicious Activity"
    description: >
      Review further malicious actions like privilege escalation or lateral movement following session hijacking.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new processes or network connections from hijacked services?"
      - "Is there unexpected credential usage?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal service restarts or administrative changes."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed hijacking attempts."
      - "High: Confirmed service session hijacking."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified session hijacking with malicious activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious session anomalies."
      - "Low: Routine administrative session changes."

ioc_types:
  - "Unexpected service restarts"
  - "DLL injection into service processes"
  - "Duplicated handles or impersonation tokens"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect DLL Injection in Service Processes"
    query: >
      process.name IN ("svchost.exe", "services.exe") AND
      event.type == "dll_injection"

  - name: "Detect Handle Duplication or Token Impersonation"
    query: >
      event.type == "handle_duplication" OR
      event.type == "token_impersonation"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious service process injections."
  - "Isolate affected services or hosts."
  - "Force credential reset if hijacking confirmed."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if service session activity is authorized."
  - "Investigate for lateral movement or privilege escalation."
  - "Implement service hardening and session monitoring."
