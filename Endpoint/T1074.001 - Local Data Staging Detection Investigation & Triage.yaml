playbook_name: "T1074.001 - Local Data Staging Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1074.001"
technique_name: "Local Data Staging"
description: >
  Detects adversaries staging collected data locally on compromised endpoints before exfiltration.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Creation of Large Files in Local Temporary Directories"
    description: >
      Detect large or archive files created in local temp folders or unusual directories.
    checklist:
      - "Are large files created in directories like C:\\Windows\\Temp or user temp folders?"
      - "Is the file type consistent with data aggregation (e.g., zip, tar)?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Endpoint detection tools"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Bulk File Access and Aggregation"
    description: >
      Observe file access patterns indicating multiple files copied or aggregated locally.
    checklist:
      - "Are many files read from diverse locations shortly before staging?"
      - "Are there processes reading large amounts of sensitive data?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "File access logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Local Staging with Subsequent Network Activity"
    description: >
      Determine if staged data is transferred externally soon after aggregation.
    checklist:
      - "Is network traffic detected shortly after data staging?"
      - "Are destination IPs or domains suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "SIEM correlation"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate local archiving activities."
      - "Medium: Suspicious file staging in uncommon locations."
      - "High: Unauthorized local data staging linked to exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious staging followed by exfiltration."
      - "Medium: Suspicious staging without further context."
      - "Low: Known user-initiated local file operations."

ioc_types:
  - "Large archive or data files in local temp directories"
  - "Bulk file read events preceding local file creation"
  - "Processes creating large files in local staging areas"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Local Large Archive Creation"
    query: >
      file.extension IN (".zip", ".rar", ".7z") AND
      file.size > 100MB AND
      file.path MATCHES ("C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp|%TEMP%")

  - name: "Bulk File Reads Before Local Staging"
    query: >
      process.name IN ("powershell.exe", "cmd.exe") AND
      file.read_count > 30 WITHIN 15 minutes

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on large file creation in local temp directories."
  - "Monitor processes performing bulk file reads."
  - "Trigger investigation workflows on detection."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if local staging activity is authorized."
  - "Check for subsequent suspicious network connections."
  - "Investigate user/process behavior for compromise."
