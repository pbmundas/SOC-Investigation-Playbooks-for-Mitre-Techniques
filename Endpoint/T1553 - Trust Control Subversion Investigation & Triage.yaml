playbook_name: "T1553 - Trust Control Subversion: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1553"
technique_name: "Trust Control Subversion"
description: >
  Detect attempts by adversaries to subvert trust controls such as digital certificates, cryptographic trust, or trusted relationships to evade defenses.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Anomalous Certificate Usage"
    description: >
      Detect use of certificates for signing binaries, scripts, or communications that deviate from baseline or known good.
    checklist:
      - "Are new or unknown certificates used to sign executables or scripts?"
      - "Are certificates recently issued or with unusual attributes?"
      - "Is there any indication of stolen or forged certificates?"
    data_sources:
      - "Code signing logs"
      - "Certificate transparency logs"
      - "File hash and signature metadata"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Tampering with Trust Stores or Policies"
    description: >
      Monitor for modifications to trust stores, root certificate stores, or cryptographic policy settings.
    checklist:
      - "Are root or intermediate certificate stores modified?"
      - "Are Group Policy or local security policies changed to relax trust requirements?"
    data_sources:
      - "Registry and file monitoring"
      - "Group Policy change logs"
      - "SIEM alerts"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Malicious or Unsigned Executables"
    description: >
      Look for execution of binaries that lack proper signatures or have invalid trust chains.
    checklist:
      - "Are executables running with invalid or missing signatures?"
      - "Are signed binaries behaving anomalously?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint protection logs"
      - "Code integrity monitoring"
      - "Process execution telemetry"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate or Contain"
    description: >
      Confirm if trust control subversion is malicious and initiate containment or remediation.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of legitimate certificate renewal or policy changes?"
      - "Are remediation actions like certificate revocation or policy rollback required?"
    data_sources:
      - "Certificate management systems"
      - "Incident response platform"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized certificate changes."
      - "Medium: Suspicious certificate or trust store modifications."
      - "High: Confirmed trust subversion with malicious intent."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known stolen certificates or forged signatures."
      - "Medium: Unusual certificate or policy changes."
      - "Low: Unverified or benign anomalies."

ioc_types:
  - "Certificate thumbprints and serial numbers"
  - "Modified trust store registry keys"
  - "Unsigned or improperly signed binaries"
  - "Altered Group Policy Objects"

queries/examples:
  - name: "New or Untrusted Code Signing Certificate Usage"
    query: >
      file.code_signature.trusted:false AND
      file.hash:NOT_IN(known_good_hashes)
  - name: "Modification of Root Certificate Store Keys"
    query: >
      registry.path:"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\Root\\Certificates" AND
      event.action:"registry_modified"
  - name: "Execution of Unsigned Binaries"
    query: >
      process.file_signature_status:"Unsigned" OR process.file_signature_status:"Invalid"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on untrusted or new code signing certificates."
  - "Block execution of unsigned or improperly signed binaries."
  - "Trigger certificate revocation or policy restoration processes."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify certificate legitimacy with PKI or certificate authorities."
  - "Review recent changes to Group Policy or trust stores."
  - "Coordinate with system administrators and PKI teams."
