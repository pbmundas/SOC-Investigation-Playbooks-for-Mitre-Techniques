playbook_name: "T1567.001 - Cloud Storage Exfiltration Detection"
tactic: "Exfiltration"
technique_id: "T1567.001"
technique_name: "Cloud Storage Exfiltration"
description: >
  Detect adversaries exfiltrating data using cloud storage services like AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Upload Activity to Cloud Storage Services"
    description: >
      Identify large or anomalous file uploads to known cloud storage domains or IPs.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual file sizes or upload frequencies?"
      - "Is upload traffic occurring at odd hours or from unusual devices?"
      - "Are the destinations known and legitimate cloud storage endpoints?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "Proxy logs"
      - "Cloud access and audit logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Endpoint Activity"
    description: >
      Check for file staging, compression, or encryption prior to upload.
    checklist:
      - "Are files prepared or modified shortly before upload?"
      - "Are suspicious processes handling files destined for cloud upload?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint file and process logs"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Review Cloud Service Account Activity"
    description: >
      Detect abnormal authentication events or permission changes in cloud storage accounts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there logins from unusual IPs or devices?"
      - "Are permission changes or API token creations observed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Cloud service audit logs"
      - "IAM and authentication logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Expected cloud storage use."
      - "Medium: Suspicious upload behavior."
      - "High: Confirmed exfiltration via cloud storage."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified upload of sensitive data."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious upload endpoints"
  - "Unusual cloud account activity"
  - "File staging processes"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Large Uploads to Cloud Storage Domains"
    query: >
      network.destination_domain IN (known_cloud_storage_domains) AND
      network.upload_bytes > threshold

  - name: "Detect Suspicious API Token Creation"
    query: >
      cloud_event.type = "CreateApiToken" AND
      cloud_event.user NOT IN known_admins

automation_hooks:
  - "Trigger alerts on anomalous uploads."
  - "Isolate endpoints if data exfiltration confirmed."
  - "Engage cloud security team for account investigation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if cloud storage use aligns with business needs."
  - "Investigate file contents if possible."
  - "Coordinate incident response if malicious."
