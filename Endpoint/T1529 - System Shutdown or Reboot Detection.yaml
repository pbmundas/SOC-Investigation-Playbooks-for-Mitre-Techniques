playbook_name: "T1529 - System Shutdown or Reboot Detection"
tactic: "Impact"
technique_id: "T1529"
technique_name: "System Shutdown/Reboot"
description: >
  Detect adversaries shutting down or rebooting systems to interrupt availability or evade detection.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor System Shutdown/Reboot Events"
    description: >
      Detect unexpected system shutdown or reboot activity.
    checklist:
      - "Are shutdown or reboot commands executed outside maintenance windows?"
      - "Are shutdown/reboot events correlated with suspicious activity?"
      - "Are unauthorized users initiating shutdown or reboot?"
    data_sources:
      - "System event logs"
      - "Command execution logs"
      - "Authentication logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Potential Indicators of Malicious Shutdown"
    description: >
      Look for shutdowns following compromise, or used to disrupt monitoring.
    checklist:
      - "Are shutdowns preceded by malware execution or lateral movement?"
      - "Are logs or monitoring services disabled before shutdown?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR telemetry"
      - "SIEM correlation rules"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Impact Activities"
    description: >
      Determine if shutdowns are part of larger attack goals like ransomware.
    checklist:
      - "Is shutdown followed by ransomware or data destruction?"
      - "Are multiple systems shut down or rebooted in sequence?"
    data_sources:
      - "Incident timelines"
      - "Network monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Scheduled or authorized shutdowns."
      - "Medium: Suspicious shutdown activity."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious shutdown/reboot."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious shutdown."
      - "Medium: Anomalous events."
      - "Low: False positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Shutdown or reboot command execution"
  - "Unauthorized user actions"
  - "Correlated malware execution"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Unexpected Shutdown Commands"
