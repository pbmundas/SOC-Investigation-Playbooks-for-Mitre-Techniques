technique_name: "Spearphishing via Attachment"
description: >
  This playbook guides SOC analysts through detecting and investigating spearphishing attempts
  where malicious attachments are used as the attack vector. It includes steps for analysis
  of email attachments, payload inspection, user activity correlation, and containment.

detection_sources:
  - Email Gateway Logs (e.g., Proofpoint, Microsoft Defender ATP, Mimecast)
  - Email Security Sandbox Reports
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  - SIEM Alerts on suspicious attachment activity
  - Threat Intelligence Platforms

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Suspicious Attachment"
    description: >
      Review email metadata and attachment characteristics.
    checklist:
      - "Verify sender's email address and domain reputation"
      - "Analyze attachment filename, type, and size"
      - "Check for common malicious attachment types (e.g., .exe, .js, .docm, .xlsm)"
      - "Look for encoded or compressed attachments (e.g., .zip, .rar) containing executables or macros"
    data_sources:
      - "Email logs"
      - "Attachment metadata"
      - "Threat intel feeds"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Submit Attachment for Analysis"
    description: >
      Send the attachment to sandbox environment or antivirus tools to check for malicious behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Upload attachment to sandbox or AV system"
      - "Review sandbox report for indicators of compromise"
      - "Identify behaviors like persistence, C2 attempts, or lateral movement"
    data_sources:
      - "Sandbox report"
      - "Antivirus scan results"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Endpoint and Network Activity"
    description: >
      Investigate whether the attachment was opened or executed, and check for associated malicious activity.
    checklist:
      - "Check EDR logs for attachment execution or script launches"
      - "Review process creation events for suspicious child processes"
      - "Look for network connections initiated post attachment execution"
      - "Correlate user activity with UBA/UEBA data for abnormal behavior"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR telemetry"
      - "Network proxy and firewall logs"
      - "UEBA reports"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Containment Actions"
    description: >
      Take steps to mitigate and prevent further compromise.
    checklist:
      - "Block sender and attachment hashes in email gateway"
      - "Quarantine or delete affected emails"
      - "Isolate infected endpoints"
      - "Reset credentials if compromise suspected"
      - "Apply endpoint protection updates and patches"
    data_sources:
      - "Email gateway controls"
      - "Endpoint management systems"
      - "Identity management"

  - step_number: 5
    title: "User Notification and Awareness"
    description: >
      Inform users of the phishing attempt and provide guidance.
    checklist:
      - "Notify affected users about the phishing campaign"
      - "Share tips on recognizing spearphishing emails"
      - "Encourage reporting of suspicious emails"
    data_sources:
      - "Security awareness tools"
      - "Internal communications platforms"

triage_labels:
  - severity:
      - "Low: Suspicious attachment, no evidence of execution"
      - "Medium: Attachment executed, no further impact"
      - "High: Execution with confirmed malicious activity or data access"
  - confidence:
      - "High: Confirmed malicious indicators in attachment and endpoint"
      - "Medium: Suspicious but inconclusive indicators"
      - "Low: Possible false positive or user error"

ioc_types:
  - Email Address
  - Sender Domain
  - Attachment Filename
  - File Hash
  - IP Address
  - URL

example_queries:
  - name: "Suspicious Attachment Emails"
    query: >
      email_attachment_filename: (*.exe OR *.js OR *.docm OR *.xlsm OR *.zip) AND
      sender_domain: ("phishingsite.com" OR "malicious.com")

  - name: "Attachment Execution Process Creation"
    query: >
      event_type=process_creation AND
      (process_name="powershell.exe" OR process_name="cmd.exe" OR process_name="wscript.exe") AND
      parent_process_name="outlook.exe"

automation_hooks:
  - "Auto quarantine emails with high-risk attachments"
  - "Submit unknown attachments to sandbox automatically"
  - "Generate tickets for analyst investigation"
  - "Trigger endpoint isolation if malicious execution detected"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Focus on attachments with executable content or macros"
  - "Correlate email and endpoint data to confirm exploitation"
  - "Prioritize containment for confirmed malicious execution"
  - "Engage users for additional context and remediation"
