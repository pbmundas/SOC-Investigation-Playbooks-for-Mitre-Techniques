playbook_name: "T1490 - System Recovery Inhibition Detection"
tactic: "Impact"
technique_id: "T1490"
technique_name: "Inhibit System Recovery"
description: >
  Detect attempts to disable or delete system recovery features to prevent recovery after impact.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor for System Recovery Feature Modifications"
    description: >
      Detect disabling or deletion of system restore points, backups, or shadow copies.
    checklist:
      - "Are system restore points deleted or disabled?"
      - "Are backup services or snapshots stopped?"
      - "Are shadow copies deleted or altered?"
    data_sources:
      - "System event logs"
      - "Backup system logs"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Administrative Tools for Recovery Inhibition"
    description: >
      Identify use of native OS tools (vssadmin, wbadmin) or scripts to inhibit recovery.
    checklist:
      - "Are commands like `vssadmin delete shadows` executed?"
      - "Is backup software disabled or uninstalled?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process command-line logs"
      - "PowerShell logs"
      - "Audit logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Impact Activities"
    description: >
      Check for concurrent ransomware or destructive activities.
    checklist:
      - "Is system recovery inhibition followed by data encryption or deletion?"
      - "Are system files or logs tampered with?"
    data_sources:
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "EDR alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Scheduled maintenance or legitimate backup activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious recovery feature changes."
      - "High: Confirmed recovery inhibition attack."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious system recovery inhibition."
      - "Medium: Suspicious behavior."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Commands disabling recovery"
  - "Deleted restore points or backups"
  - "Stopped backup services"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Shadow Copy Deletion"
