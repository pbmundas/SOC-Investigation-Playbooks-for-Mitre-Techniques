playbook_name: "T1055.006 - SetThreadContext Injection Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1055.006"
technique_name: "SetThreadContext Injection"
description: >
  Detect SetThreadContext-based code injection where adversaries control execution flow by modifying thread context in a remote process.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Use of SetThreadContext"
    description: >
      Identify sequences involving SuspendThread, VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, and SetThreadContext.
    checklist:
      - "Are remote threads being suspended and context modified?"
      - "Are executable memory regions created just before this?"
    data_sources:
      - "API telemetry"
      - "Thread context logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate with Remote Memory Allocation"
    description: >
      Validate that written memory regions are executable and used by SetThreadContext.
    checklist:
      - "Is memory marked PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE?"
      - "Is context set to point to written region?"
    data_sources:
      - "Memory mapping logs"
      - "EDR behavior traces"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Track Post-Injection Execution Behavior"
    description: >
      Follow execution from set context region and detect malicious behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Does the thread execute shellcode or malware payloads?"
      - "Are post-injection behaviors consistent with known malware?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs"
      - "SIEM alerts"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate and Respond"
    description: >
      Confirm malicious SetThreadContext injection and take action.
    checklist:
      - "Is endpoint at risk or in active compromise?"
      - "Is isolation or image capture required?"
    data_sources:
      - "Incident response actions"
      - "Threat intelligence context"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Rare legit debugging behavior."
      - "Medium: Unusual memory context setting."
      - "High: Confirmed injection via SetThreadContext."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known toolchains using this method."
      - "Medium: Suspicious API usage in sequence."
      - "Low: Unverified or incomplete sequences."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspended thread IDs"
  - "Injected memory regions"
  - "SetThreadContext API calls"
