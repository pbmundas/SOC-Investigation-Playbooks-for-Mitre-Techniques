playbook_name: "T1003.004 - LSA Secrets Credential Dumping Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1003.004"
technique_name: "LSA Secrets"
description: >
  Detect attempts to dump Local Security Authority (LSA) Secrets, which store sensitive credentials and secrets on Windows systems.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Access or Dumping of LSA Secrets"
    description: >
      Monitor for processes reading or dumping the LSA Secrets registry keys or hives.
    checklist:
      - "Are there attempts to access HKLM\\Security registry hive?"
      - "Is there execution of credential dumping tools targeting LSA Secrets?"
    data_sources:
      - "Registry access logs"
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Use of Credential Dumping Tools"
    description: >
      Detect tools like Mimikatz accessing or dumping LSA Secrets.
    checklist:
      - "Is Mimikatz executed with commands targeting LSA Secrets?"
      - "Are any suspicious or unsigned binaries performing LSA Secrets dumps?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "File and registry access logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious Behavior"
    description: >
      Look for abnormal authentication, lateral movement, or privilege escalation after dumping.
    checklist:
      - "Is there suspicious network authentication activity?"
      - "Are there signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Possible admin or backup activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access to LSA Secrets without confirmed dump."
      - "High: Confirmed LSA Secrets dumping."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known tool execution with LSA Secrets access."
      - "Medium: Unusual registry access patterns."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Registry access to HKLM\\Security hive"
  - "Known credential dumping tool executions"
  - "Process access to protected registry keys"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Mimikatz LSA Secrets Dump"
    query: >

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized registry access to LSA Secrets keys."
  - "Block execution of unauthorized credential dumping tools."
  - "Initiate incident response for confirmed dumping attempts."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if access is part of legitimate maintenance."
  - "Check subsequent suspicious activity on endpoints."
  - "Contain and remediate affected hosts."
