playbook_name: "T1119 - Automated Collection Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1119"
technique_name: "Automated Collection"
description: >
  Detects adversaries using automated tools or scripts to gather data, files, or system information to expedite data collection during an intrusion.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Execution of Collection Tools"
    description: >
      Detect execution of known automated collection tools or suspicious scripts that gather data.
    checklist:
      - "Are known data collection utilities executed?"
      - "Is there evidence of batch scripts or automated tools running?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs"
      - "Command-line auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Mass File Access or Exfiltration"
    description: >
      Monitor unusual patterns of file access or bulk copying indicative of automated data gathering.
    checklist:
      - "Are many files accessed or copied in a short timeframe?"
      - "Is there data staged for exfiltration?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system audit logs"
      - "Network monitoring for exfiltration"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Intrusion Indicators"
    description: >
      Link automated collection with prior or subsequent adversary actions such as credential theft or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Is automated collection preceded by privilege escalation?"
      - "Are there signs of lateral movement following data collection?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Process and network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal backup or legitimate data gathering."
      - "Medium: Suspicious automated data collection."
      - "High: Confirmed adversary automated data collection."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known adversary tool usage detected."
      - "Medium: Suspicious file access patterns."
      - "Low: Routine system maintenance activities."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of tools like PowerShell scripts, Mimikatz, or other collection utilities"
  - "Rapid file access or copying events"
  - "Data staging for exfiltration"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Execution of Known Collection Tools"
    query: >
      process.name IN ("mimikatz.exe", "powershell.exe") AND
      command_line CONTAINS ("Invoke-Command", "Get-Content")

  - name: "Detect Mass File Access"
    query: >
      file.access_count > 100 WITHIN 5 minutes

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on execution of suspicious data collection tools."
  - "Throttle or block mass file access."
  - "Notify incident response team."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if collection activity is authorized."
  - "Investigate associated suspicious processes and user accounts."
  - "Implement data access controls and monitoring."
