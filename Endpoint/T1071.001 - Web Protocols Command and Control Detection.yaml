playbook_name: "T1071.001 - Web Protocols Command and Control Detection"
tactic: "Command and Control"
technique_id: "T1071.001"
technique_name: "Web Protocols"
description: >
  Detect adversaries using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with command and control servers.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Analyze HTTP/HTTPS Traffic for Anomalies"
    description: >
      Look for unusual user agents, HTTP methods, or abnormal POST request payloads.
    checklist:
      - "Are there HTTP requests to suspicious or newly registered domains?"
      - "Is there abnormal frequency or timing of web requests?"
    data_sources:
      - "Proxy logs"
      - "Network IDS/IPS"
      - "Web server logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Known Malicious Web C2 Infrastructure"
    description: >
      Match traffic against threat intelligence feeds for known malicious web servers or URLs.
    checklist:
      - "Is the traffic directed to known bad domains or URLs?"
      - "Are SSL certificates self-signed or expired?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence"
      - "SSL inspection logs"
      - "DNS logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Identify Obfuscated or Encrypted Payloads in Web Traffic"
    description: >
      Detect base64 encoding, encrypted data, or other obfuscation techniques within HTTP(S) payloads.
    checklist:
      - "Are HTTP POST bodies containing encoded or encrypted data?"
      - "Is traffic volume consistent with C2 beacons?"
    data_sources:
      - "Deep packet inspection"
      - "Network traffic analytics"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal web traffic."
      - "Medium: Suspicious HTTP/HTTPS anomalies."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious web-based C2 traffic."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known IOC or confirmed obfuscation."
      - "Medium: Anomalies without direct IOC match."
      - "Low: Potential false positives from legitimate apps."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious domain names and URLs"
  - "Unusual user agents"
  - "Encoded or encrypted HTTP payloads"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect HTTP POST Requests with Base64 Payload"
    query: >
      http.method = "POST" AND
      http.request_body MATCHES "([A-Za-z0-9+/=]{100,})"

  - name: "Detect Traffic to Newly Registered or Low Reputation Domains"
    query: >
      dns.domain_registration_date < now() - 30d AND
      http.host NOT IN (trusted_domains)

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious web C2 activity."
  - "Block connections to malicious web domains."
  - "Initiate endpoint investigation on alert."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate user agent legitimacy."
  - "Correlate with endpoint alerts for persistence or lateral movement."
  - "Check for associated data exfiltration."
