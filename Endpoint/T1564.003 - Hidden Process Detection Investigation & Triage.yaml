playbook_name: "T1564.003 - Hidden Process Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1564.003"
technique_name: "Hidden Process"
description: >
  Detect adversaries hiding running processes from process listings or monitoring tools to evade detection.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Process Enumeration Discrepancies"
    description: >
      Compare process lists from different system utilities and APIs to identify hidden or unlisted processes.
    checklist:
      - "Are there processes running that do not appear in standard enumeration?"
      - "Are processes hidden via rootkits or hooking system calls?"
      - "Are suspicious DLLs or drivers loaded that facilitate hiding?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring tools"
      - "Kernel-level telemetry"
      - "Endpoint detection and response (EDR)"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Process Parent-Child Relationships"
    description: >
      Check for anomalies or gaps in the process tree indicating hidden processes.
    checklist:
      - "Are there orphaned or unexplained child processes?"
      - "Is there mismatch between process creation and visible processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process tree analysis"
      - "Event logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Hidden Processes with Malicious Behavior"
    description: >
      Identify whether hidden processes correspond to malware execution, persistence, or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Do hidden processes spawn network connections or file writes?"
      - "Are they linked to known malicious signatures or behaviors?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network monitoring"
      - "Malware detection logs"
      - "Threat intelligence"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Remediate"
    description: >
      Remove or contain hidden processes and apply detection enhancements.
    checklist:
      - "Terminate unauthorized hidden processes."
      - "Deploy kernel integrity and rootkit detection tools."
      - "Enhance process visibility and monitoring."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "IR playbooks"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known system or anti-malware hidden processes."
      - "Medium: Suspicious process hiding requiring investigation."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious hidden processes."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified hidden malicious processes."
      - "Medium: Anomalous hiding patterns."
      - "Low: Known benign hidden processes."

ioc_types:
  - "Processes not appearing in standard enumeration"
  - "Loaded rootkits or hooking drivers"
  - "Unusual process tree anomalies"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect hidden processes via enumeration differences"
    query: >
      process.count.visible < process.count.kernel_level

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on discrepancies between user-mode and kernel-mode process listings."
  - "Trigger rootkit detection scans on suspicion."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate whether hidden processes are benign (e.g., security software)."
  - "Correlate with malware behavior and threat intelligence."
  - "Use kernel-level tools for deep process inspection."

review_cycle: "Quarterly or post incident involving process hiding"
