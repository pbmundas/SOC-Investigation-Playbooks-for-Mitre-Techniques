description: >
  Detect abuse of rundll32.exe to execute malicious DLLs or payloads.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Rundll32 Execution"
    description: >
      Monitor process creation events for rundll32.exe with suspicious or unusual command line arguments.
    checklist:
      - "Is rundll32.exe loading non-standard or unsigned DLLs?"
      - "Are command lines invoking unusual functions or parameters?"
      - "Is rundll32.exe started by unexpected users or parent processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation and command line logs"
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "Endpoint telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Loaded DLLs and Command Line"
    description: >
      Investigate DLLs loaded by rundll32 for suspicious hashes or locations.
    checklist:
      - "Do loaded DLLs match known malware signatures?"
      - "Are DLLs loaded from unusual directories or network shares?"
    data_sources:
      - "File monitoring"
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Indicators"
    description: >
      Check for related suspicious process chains, network connections, or privilege escalation.
    checklist:
      - "Are rundll32 executions linked to lateral movement?"
      - "Is there concurrent malicious activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM logs"
      - "Network telemetry"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Contain"
    description: >
      Block rundll32.exe if unauthorized, isolate impacted hosts, and begin incident response.
    checklist:
      - "Implement application control or whitelisting."
      - "Engage incident response for forensic analysis."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "IR tools"
