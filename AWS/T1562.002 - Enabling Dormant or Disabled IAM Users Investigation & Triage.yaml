playbook_name: "T1562.002 - Enabling Dormant or Disabled IAM Users: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1562.002"
technique_name: "Enabling Dormant or Disabled IAM Users"
description: >
  Detect attempts to enable previously disabled or dormant IAM users, which may be used by attackers to regain access or evade detection.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Enabling or Reactivation of IAM Users"
    description: >
      Monitor CloudTrail for API calls that reactivate or enable IAM users, such as UpdateLoginProfile or EnableUser.
    checklist:
      - "Are login profiles re-created or updated for dormant/disabled users?"
      - "Are access keys reactivated or created for these users?"
      - "Is the activity performed by authorized personnel?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail (UpdateLoginProfile, CreateAccessKey, ActivateMFADevice)"
      - "AWS IAM Credential Reports"
      - "AWS Config"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Review User Activity Before and After Enabling"
    description: >
      Analyze recent activity of the user prior to enabling and subsequent usage.
    checklist:
      - "Was the user inactive for an extended period before enabling?"
      - "Is there sudden unusual activity after reactivation?"
      - "Are access patterns consistent with legitimate use?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail"
      - "Authentication and access logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Suspicious Actions"
    description: >
      Look for related suspicious behavior around the time of enabling, such as privilege escalation or data access.
    checklist:
      - "Is there creation of new roles or policies soon after enabling?"
      - "Are there attempts to disable logging or monitoring?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "AWS Config"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized user reactivation."
      - "Medium: Unexpected enabling of dormant users."
      - "High: Unauthorized enabling with suspicious activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known attacker or unusual IP enabling user."
      - "Medium: Unusual timing or IP, unclear intent."
      - "Low: Routine maintenance or support actions."

ioc_types:
  - "UpdateLoginProfile API calls on dormant users"
  - "CreateAccessKey or ActivateMFADevice for disabled users"
  - "IAM user reactivation patterns"

queries/examples:
