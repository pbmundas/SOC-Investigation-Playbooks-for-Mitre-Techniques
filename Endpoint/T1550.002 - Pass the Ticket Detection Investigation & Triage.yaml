playbook_name: "T1550.002 - Pass the Ticket Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1550.002"
technique_name: "Pass the Ticket"
description: >
  Detects adversaries using stolen Kerberos tickets (TGTs or service tickets) to authenticate without credentials.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Anomalous Kerberos Ticket Usage"
    description: >
      Monitor for tickets used outside of normal user behavior such as unusual source IPs, times, or ticket lifetimes.
    checklist:
      - "Are Kerberos tickets used from unusual hosts or IPs?"
      - "Are ticket lifetimes or renewal patterns abnormal?"
    data_sources:
      - "Kerberos authentication logs"
      - "Security event logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Use of Tickets with Elevated Privileges"
    description: >
      Look for tickets granting high privilege access inconsistent with normal user roles.
    checklist:
      - "Are tickets for privileged accounts used in unexpected contexts?"
      - "Is there use of tickets for admin or service accounts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Access control logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Ticket Theft or Dumping Activities"
    description: >
      Check for prior credential theft events such as ticket dumping tools (e.g., Mimikatz).
    checklist:
      - "Was ticket theft observed on source systems?"
      - "Are there tools or commands executed related to ticket extraction?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection logs"
      - "Process execution logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Single anomalous ticket usage without follow-up."
      - "Medium: Multiple suspicious ticket uses."
      - "High: Confirmed lateral movement or privilege escalation using tickets."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed use of stolen tickets."
      - "Medium: Anomalous ticket usage patterns."
      - "Low: Potential false positives due to legitimate activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Kerberos ticket usage from unusual IP addresses"
  - "Tickets granting elevated privileges used unexpectedly"
  - "Execution of ticket dumping tools"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Kerberos Ticket Usage from Untrusted IP"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on anomalous ticket usage."
  - "Isolate endpoints where ticket theft detected."
  - "Force password and ticket resets."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review ticket usage logs and correlate with user activity."
  - "Investigate source systems for signs of compromise."
  - "Recommend disabling cached tickets and enforcing strong ticket policies."
