playbook_name: "T1134.002 - Process Creation with Token Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Privilege Escalation"
technique_id: "T1134.002"
technique_name: "Create Process with Token"
description: >
  Detect scenarios where adversaries use CreateProcessWithToken or CreateProcessAsUser to spawn new processes under a different userâ€™s context.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor CreateProcessWithToken/AsUser APIs"
    description: >
      Detect use of process creation APIs tied to token misuse.
    checklist:
      - "Are low-privilege processes spawning high-privilege processes?"
      - "Are these APIs called without interactive login?"
    data_sources:
      - "API telemetry"
      - "Process creation logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Check Process Lineage"
    description: >
      Validate parent-child process relationships for token usage.
    checklist:
      - "Does the parent process have matching privileges to child?"
      - "Are tokens reused between unrelated processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process tree analysis"
      - "Security logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Privilege Abuse Patterns"
    description: >
      Identify behavior aligning with lateral movement or privilege escalation.
    checklist:
      - "Is the token reused to access remote shares or processes?"
      - "Is there a sudden privilege escalation in logs?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM logs"
      - "Windows Event ID 4688"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate and Contain"
    description: >
      Confirm abuse of token for process creation and mitigate.
    checklist:
      - "Is this technique used in conjunction with credential theft?"
      - "Should the token be revoked or host isolated?"
    data_sources:
      - "Incident response tools"
      - "EDR analysis"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Admin tool usage in controlled context."
      - "Medium: Unexpected process lineage with token elevation."
      - "High: Confirmed privilege escalation via token."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known attacker technique."
      - "Medium: Partially aligned with misuse."
      - "Low: Unconfirmed sequence."

ioc_types:
  - "CreateProcessWithToken API calls"
  - "User tokens used cross-session"
  - "Elevated process ancestry"
