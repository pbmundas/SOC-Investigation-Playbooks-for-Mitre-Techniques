playbook_name: "T1003.001 - LSASS Credential Dumping Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1003.001"
technique_name: "LSASS Memory"
description: >
  Detect attempts to dump credentials from the LSASS process memory, often targeted to extract plaintext passwords, hashes, or Kerberos tickets.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Access or Dumping of LSASS Memory"
    description: >
      Monitor processes accessing or dumping LSASS process memory.
    checklist:
      - "Are there suspicious processes opening LSASS with high privileges?"
      - "Is there creation of memory dump files of LSASS?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process access logs"
      - "File creation logs"
      - "Windows Event Logs (Event ID 10, 4688)"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Known Tools or Commands Used"
    description: >
      Detect execution of credential dumping tools or commands targeting LSASS.
    checklist:
      - "Is Mimikatz or other known tools executed?"
      - "Are debugging tools or utilities (e.g., procdump.exe) used on LSASS?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line arguments"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious Behavior"
    description: >
      Look for lateral movement or abnormal account activity after dumping.
    checklist:
      - "Is there suspicious network logins or authentication attempts?"
      - "Is there unusual file or process activity following dump?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network logs"
      - "Endpoint logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate administrative tools usage."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access to LSASS memory."
      - "High: Confirmed credential dumping from LSASS."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known tool execution and dump creation."
      - "Medium: Unusual process access to LSASS."
      - "Low: Possible false positives from monitoring gaps."

ioc_types:
  - "Process opening LSASS.exe memory"
  - "Memory dump files related to LSASS"
  - "Known credential dumping tools/processes"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect procdump Usage on LSASS"
    query: >
      process.name:"procdump.exe" AND process.command_line:"-ma lsass.exe"
  - name: "Detect Mimikatz LSASS Access"
    query: >

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on high-privilege process access to LSASS."
  - "Block unauthorized tools accessing LSASS memory."
  - "Trigger immediate incident response workflow."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if process access is authorized (e.g., sysadmins)."
  - "Investigate timeline for lateral movement or suspicious activity."
  - "Contain compromised systems quickly."
