tactic: "Privilege Escalation"
technique_id: "T1548.002"
technique_name: "Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Setuid/Setgid"
description: >
  Detect unauthorized privilege escalation through misuse of Setuid or Setgid binaries on Unix-like systems.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Scan for Setuid/Setgid Binaries"
    description: >
      Identify unusual or unauthorized binaries with Setuid/Setgid bits.
    checklist:
      - "Are there non-standard Setuid/Setgid binaries in user directories?"
      - "Are any sensitive scripts or interpreters marked Setuid?"
    data_sources:
      - "Filesystem scanning (e.g., `find` command)"
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Execution of Setuid/Setgid Binaries"
    description: >
      Monitor runtime execution of Setuid/Setgid files.
    checklist:
      - "Is the execution context elevated?"
      - "Was the binary used to spawn a shell or execute privileged operations?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Auditd / audit.log"
      - "Linux EDR logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Trace Origin and Changes"
    description: >
      Investigate creation/modification and origin of binaries.
    checklist:
      - "Who created or modified the file?"
      - "Was chmod or chown used to set Setuid/Setgid?"
    data_sources:
      - "Audit logs"
      - "File integrity monitoring"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Remediate and Harden"
    description: >
      Remove or restrict abuse potential.
    checklist:
      - "Remove unnecessary Setuid/Setgid permissions."
      - "Implement AppArmor/SELinux policies."
    data_sources:
      - "System hardening tools"
      - "IAM and file ACLs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known system Setuid binary."
      - "Medium: Non-system Setuid/Setgid file."
      - "High: Malicious Setuid file executing shell or backdoor."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed Setuid binary abuse."
      - "Medium: Unusual file permissions."
      - "Low: Benign usage or FP."

ioc_types:
  - "Setuid file hashes"
  - "Unusual Setuid file paths"
  - "Processes launched from Setuid binaries"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Find Setuid/Setgid Files"
    query: >
      find / -perm /6000 -type f -exec ls -l {} \;

  - name: "Audit Setuid Binary Execution"
    query: >
      audit.type=EXECVE AND (perm="setuid" OR perm="setgid")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on creation of new Setuid binaries."
  - "Auto-quarantine suspicious files with Setuid bits."
  - "Trigger forensic collection on Setuid binary execution."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Investigate if the Setuid permission was set intentionally."
  - "Assess access paths and lateral movement potential."
  - "Coordinate with Unix/Linux admin teams."
