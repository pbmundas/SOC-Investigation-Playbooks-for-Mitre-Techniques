playbook_name: "T1562.001.001 - Disabling IAM Users to Evade Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1562.001"
technique_name: "Disabling IAM Users"
description: >
  Detect attempts to disable IAM users, such as removing login profiles or credentials, aimed at evading detection or locking out legitimate users.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Disabling Actions on IAM Users"
    description: >
      Monitor CloudTrail for actions like DeleteLoginProfile or RemoveAccessKey.
    checklist:
      - "Are login profiles deleted or access keys removed unexpectedly?"
      - "Is disabling activity performed outside normal maintenance windows?"
      - "Is disabling done by authorized personnel?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail (DeleteLoginProfile, DeleteAccessKey, UpdateLoginProfile)"
      - "AWS IAM credential reports"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Assess Impact of Disabling Actions"
    description: >
      Determine which users are disabled and if it affects legitimate access.
    checklist:
      - "Are critical or admin users disabled?"
      - "Is there a pattern of disabling multiple users?"
    data_sources:
      - "IAM user status"
      - "CloudTrail logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Disabling Events with Suspicious Behavior"
    description: >
      Investigate whether disabling was used to evade detection or facilitate malicious activity.
    checklist:
      - "Is there follow-up unauthorized activity?"
      - "Are affected users reporting access issues?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Incident reports"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized user disabling."
      - "Medium: Unusual disabling activity."
      - "High: Unauthorized disabling for evasion."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Direct evidence of unauthorized disabling."
      - "Medium: Anomalous disabling without clear cause."
      - "Low: Maintenance or admin activities."

ioc_types:
  - "DeleteLoginProfile events"
  - "RemoveAccessKey events"
  - "UpdateLoginProfile disabling"

queries/examples:

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on login profile deletion by non-authorized users."
  - "Automate user access recovery if disabling is suspicious."
  - "Block further login profile deletion attempts."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify with IAM admins about the purpose of disabling."
  - "Immediately restore disabled user access if unauthorized."
  - "Monitor for lateral movement or suspicious login attempts."
