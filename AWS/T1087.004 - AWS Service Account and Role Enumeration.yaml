playbook_name: "T1087.004 - AWS Service Account and Role Enumeration"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1087.004"
technique_name: "Account Discovery: Cloud Account"
description: >
  Detect attempts to enumerate AWS service-linked roles, assumed roles, and identity-linked services 
  which can reveal critical paths to lateral movement or privilege abuse.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor for ListRoles and GetRole Calls to Service Accounts"
    description: >
      Identify excessive use of IAM enumeration focused on service accounts or linked roles.
    checklist:
      - "Are role names containing 'AWSServiceRole', 'CodeBuild', or 'Lambda' queried?"
      - "Are these calls made by a user who doesn't typically manage IAM?"
      - "Is the role assumption attempted right after enumeration?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "IAM Access Analyzer"
      - "GuardDuty (Policy: Credential Access via Role Discovery)"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Cross-Check Role Listing with Usage or Exploit Attempts"
    description: >
      Determine if the roles found via enumeration were later used for session creation or privilege escalation.
    checklist:
      - "Was `sts:AssumeRole` called with any of the listed roles?"
      - "Are downstream API calls made with temporary credentials?"
      - "Was a new trust policy added after enumeration?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail STS events"
      - "IAM Policy change logs"
      - "Access Advisor data"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate infrastructure scan."
      - "Medium: Suspicious IAM user listing critical service roles."
      - "High: Role enumeration followed by `AssumeRole` usage."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Role enumeration used for exploitation."
      - "Medium: Role discovered from unauthorized principal."
      - "Low: Known developer script misconfiguration."

ioc_types:
  - "ListRoles focused on AWS service-linked role patterns"
  - "AssumeRole attempts with discovered service accounts"
  - "IAM trust policy modifications"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Service Role Enumeration"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventName=ListRoles AND responseElements.roles[*].roleName CONTAINS ("AWSServiceRole", "Lambda", "CodeBuild")
  - name: "Role Follow-up Exploitation"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventName=AssumeRole AND requestParameters.roleArn IN discoveredRolesList

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on role enumeration outside known IAM administrators."
  - "Tag suspicious roles for usage monitoring."
  - "Enable access advisor review on affected roles."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Determine context of IAM user performing the listing."
  - "Trace back to originating device/IP via CloudTrail."
  - "Correlate with policy changes or session sprawl."
