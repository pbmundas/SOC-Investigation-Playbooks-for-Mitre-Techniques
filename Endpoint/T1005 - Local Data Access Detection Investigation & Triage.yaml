playbook_name: "T1005 - Local Data Access Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1005"
technique_name: "Local Data Access"
description: >
  Detects adversaries accessing sensitive data stored locally on compromised systems to collect information.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to Sensitive Data Files"
    description: >
      Identify access or read events on files or directories containing sensitive data.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual file access patterns on sensitive or critical data files?"
      - "Is the access performed by unauthorized users or unusual processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access logs"
      - "Endpoint detection and response (EDR) telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Abnormal Bulk File Reads"
    description: >
      Monitor for processes reading large amounts of files or data in a short time frame.
    checklist:
      - "Are there multiple files accessed rapidly by the same process?"
      - "Are the accessed files from sensitive directories?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring logs"
      - "File system monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Suspicious Activities"
    description: >
      Check if local data access correlates with lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data staging.
    checklist:
      - "Is local data access followed by network activity or file copying?"
      - "Are the accessing accounts compromised or suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "User activity monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Access by authorized users or backup processes."
      - "Medium: Access to sensitive data by unusual accounts."
      - "High: Unauthorized or suspicious bulk data access."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified unauthorized access to sensitive data."
      - "Medium: Suspicious file access patterns."
      - "Low: Normal user activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Unusual file read events on sensitive directories"
  - "Processes reading large volumes of files quickly"
  - "Access by suspicious or unknown user accounts"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Bulk File Reads in Sensitive Directories"
    query: >
      file.access_type = "read" AND
      file.path MATCHES ("/confidential|/secret|/finance|/hr/") AND
      file.read_count > 20 WITHIN 10 minutes

  - name: "Unusual User Access to Sensitive Files"
    query: >
      user.name NOT IN ("backup", "admin") AND
      file.access_type = "read" AND
      file.path MATCHES ("/sensitive_data/")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on bulk access to sensitive local files."
  - "Restrict or quarantine suspicious processes."
  - "Notify security team for incident review."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if data access was authorized."
  - "Investigate processes and users involved."
  - "Check for related suspicious activities such as exfiltration."
