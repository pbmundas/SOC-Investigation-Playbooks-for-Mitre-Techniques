playbook_name: "T1087 - Account Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1087"
technique_name: "Account Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries enumerating local or domain accounts to gather information for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Commands and Tools for Account Enumeration"
    description: >
      Identify usage of native or third-party tools and commands used for account discovery (e.g., net user, Get-ADUser).
    checklist:
      - "Are there command-line invocations related to account enumeration?"
      - "Are PowerShell cmdlets like Get-LocalUser or Get-ADUser being executed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs"
      - "Command-line auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Unusual Account Enumeration Activity"
    description: >
      Look for anomalous patterns such as account enumeration from non-admin users or during unusual hours.
    checklist:
      - "Is account enumeration performed by unexpected users or hosts?"
      - "Are there repeated enumeration attempts?"
    data_sources:
      - "User activity logs"
      - "Authentication logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Reconnaissance or Lateral Movement Indicators"
    description: >
      Check if account discovery activities align with other suspicious behaviors like network scanning or credential access.
    checklist:
      - "Is account discovery followed by privilege escalation or lateral movement?"
      - "Are other reconnaissance tools observed on the same hosts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Single account enumeration by authorized users."
      - "Medium: Multiple enumerations by suspicious users."
      - "High: Enumeration linked to active intrusion or lateral movement."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized account enumeration."
      - "Medium: Suspicious command activity without full context."
      - "Low: False positives due to administrative scans."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of net user, dsquery, or PowerShell account enumeration commands"
  - "Access to account directory services logs"
  - "Unusual or repeated queries for account details"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect net user Command Usage"
    query: >
      process.name == "cmd.exe" AND
      process.command_line CONTAINS "net user"

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Get-ADUser Cmdlet Usage"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-ADUser"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on detection of account enumeration commands."
  - "Block suspicious enumeration processes if possible."
  - "Increase monitoring on accounts performing discovery."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify user intent and permissions."
  - "Correlate with ongoing investigations for potential compromise."
  - "Recommend restricting enumeration tools to authorized users."
