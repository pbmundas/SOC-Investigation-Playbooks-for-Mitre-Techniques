playbook_name: "T1027.003 - Steganography Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1027.003"
technique_name: "Steganography"
description: >
  Detect use of steganography to hide data within images, audio, or other files.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Files with Steganographic Content"
    description: >
      Detect files with unusual metadata, size anomalies, or embedded hidden data.
    checklist:
      - "Are image/audio files larger than expected?"
      - "Are metadata or headers inconsistent with file type?"
    data_sources:
      - "File metadata analysis"
      - "File size anomaly detection"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Network Traffic for Steganographic Transfers"
    description: >
      Identify exfiltration attempts using steganographic files.
    checklist:
      - "Are large image/audio files sent over unusual protocols?"
      - "Is traffic timing or pattern suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "Proxy logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Use Specialized Tools to Extract Hidden Data"
    description: >
      Apply steganalysis tools to suspected files for hidden payload extraction.
    checklist:
      - "Can hidden data be extracted or detected?"
      - "Is extracted data malicious or suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "Steganalysis tool outputs"
      - "Malware analysis labs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate use of media files."
      - "Medium: Suspicious steganographic files detected."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious hidden payload."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Extracted hidden malicious data."
      - "Medium: Anomalies detected without extraction."
      - "Low: False positives from benign files."

ioc_types:
  - "Image/audio files with hidden data"
  - "Suspicious metadata or headers"
  - "Network traffic carrying steganographic files"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Large Image Files"
    query: >
      file.extension:(jpg OR png OR bmp) AND file.size:[500000 TO *]
  - name: "Network Transfer of Media Files"
    query: >
      network.transport:(http OR https) AND file.extension:(jpg OR mp3)

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on large media files transferred unusually."
  - "Trigger steganalysis on files flagged as suspicious."
  - "Integrate with malware sandbox for payload extraction."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if large files are normal for environment."
  - "Use steganalysis tools on suspicious files."
  - "Correlate with other attacker activity indicators."
