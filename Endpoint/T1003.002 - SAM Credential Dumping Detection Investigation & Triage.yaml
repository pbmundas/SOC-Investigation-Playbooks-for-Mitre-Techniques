playbook_name: "T1003.002 - SAM Credential Dumping Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1003.002"
technique_name: "Security Account Manager (SAM)"
description: >
  Detect attempts to dump the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, which stores hashed user credentials on Windows systems.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Access or Dumping of SAM Database"
    description: >
      Monitor for access to or copying of SAM database files.
    checklist:
      - "Are processes accessing or copying SAM files (e.g., %SystemRoot%\\System32\\config\\SAM)?"
      - "Is there abnormal file access or export attempts?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access logs"
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Windows Event Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Known Credential Dumping Tools Targeting SAM"
    description: >
      Detect execution of tools or commands used to extract SAM hashes.
    checklist:
      - "Is 'reg.exe' or 'samdump2' or Mimikatz used to dump SAM?"
      - "Are registry hives exported or copied?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line arguments"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious Activity Post-Dump"
    description: >
      Look for signs of lateral movement, brute force, or unauthorized authentication using extracted hashes.
    checklist:
      - "Are there suspicious authentication failures or successes?"
      - "Is there evidence of Pass-the-Hash attacks?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate backup or admin activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious SAM access without known tool."
      - "High: Confirmed SAM hash dumping."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known tool execution with SAM access."
      - "Medium: Suspicious SAM file access."
      - "Low: Possible benign access."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to SAM database files"
  - "Registry hive exports"
  - "Credential dumping tool execution"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Registry Export of SAM"

  - name: "Detect Mimikatz SAM Dump"
    query: >
      process.name:"mimikatz.exe" AND process.command_line:"sekurlsa"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized access to SAM files."
  - "Block suspicious tool executions."
  - "Trigger forensic analysis on accessed SAM files."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate administrative tasks."
  - "Check for subsequent credential misuse."
  - "Take remediation action if unauthorized."
