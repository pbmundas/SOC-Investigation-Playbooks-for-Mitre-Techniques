technique_name: "System Process Creation or Modification"
description: >
  Detect adversaries creating or modifying system processes to establish persistence or execute malicious code.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify New or Modified System Processes"
    description: >
      Detect creation or modification of system-level processes and services.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new processes running with SYSTEM or high privileges?"
      - "Are existing system processes modified or replaced?"
      - "Are suspicious binaries launched as system processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Parent-Child Process Relationships"
    description: >
      Investigate anomalous parentage of system processes.
    checklist:
      - "Are system processes spawned by unexpected parents?"
      - "Is there evidence of process hollowing or injection?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process trees"
      - "Memory forensics"
      - "EDR hooks"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Persistence Mechanisms"
    description: >
      Link process changes to known persistence techniques.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new services or scheduled tasks associated?"
      - "Is there registry or file system persistence aligned with process changes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Service and task logs"
      - "Registry monitoring"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate or Initiate Response"
    description: >
      Confirm legitimacy or respond to suspicious process modifications.
    checklist:
      - "Is process creation/modification authorized (patch, update)?"
      - "Is immediate containment needed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Change management"
      - "Incident response"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized system updates."
      - "Medium: Suspicious modifications without confirmed impact."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious system process creation/modification."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: IOC or known malicious hashes."
      - "Medium: Anomalous behavior without confirmation."
      - "Low: Known benign process changes."

ioc_types:
  - "Process hashes and names"
  - "Parent process anomalies"
  - "Modified system binaries"
  - "Service and scheduled task changes"

queries/examples:
  - name: "System Process Creation with Elevated Privileges"
    query: >
      process.parent.name:"services.exe" AND
      process.token.integrity_level:("System" OR "High")
  - name: "Modified System Executable Detection"
    query: >
      file.path:"C:\\Windows\\System32\\*" AND
      file.hash:NOT_IN(known_good_hashes) AND
      event.action:"file_modified"
  - name: "Anomalous Parent-Child Process Chains"
    query: >
      process.parent.name:NOT("services.exe" OR "svchost.exe") AND
      process.name:"svchost.exe"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on new or modified system processes with elevated privileges."
  - "Block execution of suspicious system binaries."
  - "Trigger forensic analysis on anomalous process trees."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate process changes against patch/update schedules."
  - "Review process trees for hijack or injection."
  - "Coordinate with patch management and IR teams."
