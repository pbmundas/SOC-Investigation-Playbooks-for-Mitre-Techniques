playbook_name: "T1571 - Web Service Command and Control Detection"
tactic: "Command and Control"
technique_id: "T1571"
technique_name: "Web Service"
description: >
  Detect adversaries using web services (e.g., Google Docs, Twitter, Dropbox) as a command and control channel.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Web Service Traffic Patterns"
    description: >
      Identify unusual or suspicious traffic to web service endpoints, including anomalous request frequency or uncommon API usage.
    checklist:
      - "Are there spikes in traffic volume or frequency to web services?"
      - "Is there access to unusual or unauthorized web services?"
      - "Are API calls containing suspicious or encoded payloads?"
    data_sources:
      - "Proxy logs"
      - "Firewall logs"
      - "Web gateway logs"
      - "API monitoring tools"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Web Service Payloads and URLs"
    description: >
      Inspect content for signs of encoded commands, data exfiltration, or abnormal request structures.
    checklist:
      - "Are payloads base64 or otherwise encoded?"
      - "Are URLs unusually long or contain random strings?"
      - "Is there evidence of automated or scripted web service interactions?"
    data_sources:
      - "Web proxy logs"
      - "Network packet captures"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Cross-reference Web Service Access with User and Endpoint Behavior"
    description: >
      Correlate web service usage with endpoint logs and user activity to detect suspicious patterns.
    checklist:
      - "Is web service access occurring outside normal hours?"
      - "Are there multiple endpoints accessing the same suspicious web service?"
      - "Are user accounts exhibiting unusual access patterns?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "User authentication logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal web service usage."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or anomalous web service access."
      - "High: Confirmed web service-based C2 activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Payload or IOC match."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Potential false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious web service URLs or API endpoints"
  - "Encoded payloads in HTTP requests"
  - "Unusual web service access patterns"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Unusual POST Requests to Web Services"
    query: >
      http.method = "POST" AND
      http.host IN ("docs.google.com", "dropbox.com", "twitter.com") AND
      http.request_body MATCHES "base64"

  - name: "Detect High Frequency of Requests to Web Services"
    query: >
      count(http.request) BY http.host > threshold WITHIN 5m

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious web service activity."
  - "Block or throttle suspicious web service access."
  - "Trigger endpoint investigations for involved hosts."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review payload content for encoded commands."
  - "Check for lateral movement or data exfiltration."
  - "Coordinate with cloud or SaaS admins for deeper insight."
