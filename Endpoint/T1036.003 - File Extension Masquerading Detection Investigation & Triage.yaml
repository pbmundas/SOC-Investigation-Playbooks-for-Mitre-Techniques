playbook_name: "T1036.003 - File Extension Masquerading Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1036.003"
technique_name: "File Extension Masquerading"
description: >
  Detect adversaries using deceptive file extensions (e.g., 'file.txt.exe') to masquerade malicious files as benign.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Suspicious File Extensions"
    description: >
      Search for files with double or misleading extensions.
    checklist:
      - "Are files using extensions to disguise executable content?"
      - "Are suspicious files located in user directories or temp folders?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system scans"
      - "Endpoint telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Verify File Types and Signatures"
    description: >
      Check the actual file type and digital signatures, ignoring the displayed extension.
    checklist:
      - "Does the file content match the extension?"
      - "Are digital signatures valid?"
    data_sources:
      - "File metadata"
      - "Digital signature logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Monitor Execution of Masqueraded Files"
    description: >
      Detect execution or loading of files masquerading via extensions.
    checklist:
      - "Is a file with a misleading extension executed?"
      - "Does the process exhibit suspicious behavior?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Mitigate"
    description: >
      Block or quarantine suspicious files and alert users.
    checklist:
      - "Remove masqueraded files."
      - "Educate users on extension risks."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint protection"
      - "User awareness systems"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known safe files with unusual extensions."
      - "Medium: Suspicious masquerading files."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious masquerading."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious files."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed."
      - "Low: False positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Files with double extensions"
  - "Mismatch between file extension and type"
  - "Unsigned executable files"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect files with double extensions"
    query: >

automation_hooks:
  - "Block execution of files with suspicious extensions."
  - "Trigger alerts on download or creation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review file content regardless of extension."
  - "Confirm source and user action related to file."
