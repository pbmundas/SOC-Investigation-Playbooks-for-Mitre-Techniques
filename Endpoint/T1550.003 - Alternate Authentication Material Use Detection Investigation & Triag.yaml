playbook_name: "T1550.003 - Alternate Authentication Material Use Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1550.003"
technique_name: "Use Alternate Authentication Material"
description: >
  Detects adversaries leveraging alternate authentication materials such as smart cards, biometric tokens, or multi-factor authentication artifacts to gain access.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Unusual Use of Smart Cards or Biometrics"
    description: >
      Monitor logs for unexpected smart card or biometric authentication events.
    checklist:
      - "Are smart card logins occurring from unusual locations or times?"
      - "Is biometric authentication triggered in anomalous patterns?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Access control logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Multi-Factor Authentication Tokens"
    description: >
      Look for suspicious usage of MFA tokens, including replay or misuse of temporary credentials.
    checklist:
      - "Are MFA tokens used multiple times or outside user profiles?"
      - "Are temporary tokens being reused or misapplied?"
    data_sources:
      - "MFA logs"
      - "Authentication gateways"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Alternate Auth Material Use with Suspicious Access"
    description: >
      Confirm if the alternate authentication material usage results in unauthorized access.
    checklist:
      - "Is there access to sensitive systems immediately following alternate auth?"
      - "Does access deviate from normal user patterns?"
    data_sources:
      - "Access logs"
      - "User behavior analytics"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate use of alternate auth material."
      - "Medium: Unusual but not confirmed malicious use."
      - "High: Unauthorized or anomalous use leading to sensitive access."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed misuse or theft of alternate authentication artifacts."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed patterns."
      - "Low: Normal but flagged due to anomalies."

ioc_types:
  - "Unusual smart card or biometric auth events"
  - "Repeated MFA token use or replay"
  - "Access from new or untrusted devices using alternate auth"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Smart Card Authentication from Unusual Location"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious alternate auth material usage."
  - "Revoke or reset compromised authentication tokens."
  - "Require re-enrollment for affected authentication methods."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify authentication device ownership and status."
  - "Investigate access logs for related suspicious activity."
  - "Recommend tighter controls on alternate authentication methods."
