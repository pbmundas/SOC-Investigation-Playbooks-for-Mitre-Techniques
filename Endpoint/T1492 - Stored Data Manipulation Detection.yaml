playbook_name: "T1492 - Stored Data Manipulation Detection"
tactic: "Impact"
technique_id: "T1492"
technique_name: "Stored Data Manipulation"
description: >
  Detect adversaries manipulating stored data to impact the integrity or availability of information.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Critical Data Integrity"
    description: >
      Identify unauthorized changes to critical stored data or databases.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected changes in database entries or file content?"
      - "Are unauthorized accounts or processes modifying stored data?"
      - "Are logs showing anomalies in data access or modification times?"
    data_sources:
      - "Database audit logs"
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "Application logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Malicious Data Manipulation Tools or Scripts"
    description: >
      Detect usage of unauthorized tools or scripts altering stored data.
    checklist:
      - "Are scripting engines (PowerShell, Python) invoked to modify data?"
      - "Are uncommon or suspicious utilities accessing data stores?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Command-line logging"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Account or System Compromise"
    description: >
      Investigate if compromised credentials or systems are involved in data manipulation.
    checklist:
      - "Are privileged accounts used unusually for data modification?"
      - "Is there evidence of lateral movement preceding manipulation?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "EDR alerts"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized data changes."
      - "Medium: Suspicious data modifications."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious data manipulation."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified data tampering."
      - "Medium: Anomalous activity."
      - "Low: Potential false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Unexpected data modifications"
  - "Suspicious script usage"
  - "Unauthorized account activity"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Unauthorized Database Changes"
    query: >
      db.audit.action = "update" AND
      user NOT IN (authorized_users) AND
      timestamp > recent_timeframe

  - name: "Detect File Integrity Anomalies"
    query: >
      file.hash.changed = true AND
      file.path IN (critical_data_paths)

automation_hooks:
  - "Trigger alerts on unauthorized data changes."
  - "Isolate affected systems."
  - "Engage data owners and incident response."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if data changes were authorized."
  - "Review access logs and system activity."
  - "Coordinate recovery or rollback."
