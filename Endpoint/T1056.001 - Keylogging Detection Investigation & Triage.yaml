playbook_name: "T1056.001 - Keylogging Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1056.001"
technique_name: "Keylogging"
description: >
  Detects adversaries capturing keystrokes by monitoring for keylogger malware or suspicious hooks into input devices.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Keylogger Process Execution"
    description: >
      Detect execution of known or suspicious keylogger binaries or scripts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unknown or unsigned processes hooking keyboard inputs?"
      - "Is there evidence of process injection or hooking APIs related to input?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "API monitoring (hooking detection)"
      - "Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor Keylogger Log Files or Artifacts"
    description: >
      Detect creation or access to files commonly used by keyloggers to store captured keystrokes.
    checklist:
      - "Are log files with keystroke patterns created or modified?"
      - "Are these files accessed or transmitted externally?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Network logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Keylogging with Sensitive Data Access or Exfiltration"
    description: >
      Investigate whether keylogging activity is followed by credential use or data exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Is there network communication shortly after keystroke capture?"
      - "Are compromised credentials detected following keylogging?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network monitoring"
      - "Authentication logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized or benign keylogger usage."
      - "Medium: Suspicious keylogging without confirmed malicious activity."
      - "High: Malicious keylogging linked to credential theft or espionage."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed keylogger execution and data exfiltration."
      - "Medium: Detection of input hooks or keylogger processes."
      - "Low: Legitimate monitoring tools."

ioc_types:
  - "Keylogger process execution"
  - "Creation or access of keystroke log files"
  - "Outbound network traffic containing captured keystrokes"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Known Keylogger Executables"
    query: >
      process.name IN ("keylogger.exe", "kl.exe", "hooklogger.exe")

  - name: "Detect Input API Hooking"
    query: >
      process.api_calls CONTAINS ("SetWindowsHookEx", "GetAsyncKeyState")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on keylogger execution and input hooking."
  - "Block suspicious keystroke log file transmissions."
  - "Notify SOC team for immediate investigation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if keylogging is authorized (e.g., corporate monitoring)."
  - "Trace process lineage and user context."
  - "Search for related credential theft or lateral movement."
