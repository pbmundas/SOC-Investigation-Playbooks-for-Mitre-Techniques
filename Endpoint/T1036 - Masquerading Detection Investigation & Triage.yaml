playbook_name: "T1036 - Masquerading Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1036"
technique_name: "Masquerading"
description: >
  Detect attempts to disguise malicious files, processes, or accounts by using names or paths similar to legitimate ones.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Suspicious Names or Paths"
    description: >
      Detect files or processes using names similar to trusted binaries or services but located in unusual paths or with suspicious extensions.
    checklist:
      - "Are file names similar to system binaries but in non-standard locations?"
      - "Are extensions misleading (e.g., .exe vs .txt)?"
      - "Are digital signatures missing or invalid?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system scans"
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Digital signature verification"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Compare Hashes and Signatures"
    description: >
      Verify hashes and digital signatures of suspicious files against known good binaries.
    checklist:
      - "Does the file hash differ from the legitimate binary?"
      - "Is the digital signature absent or untrusted?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence"
      - "Endpoint protection logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Monitor Execution of Masqueraded Binaries"
    description: >
      Observe execution context and behavior for signs of masqueraded malware.
    checklist:
      - "Is the process spawning suspicious child processes?"
      - "Are there abnormal network connections?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process telemetry"
      - "Network monitoring"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Quarantine"
    description: >
      Isolate or remove masqueraded binaries and reinforce file integrity monitoring.
    checklist:
      - "Quarantine suspicious files."
      - "Alert on new masquerading attempts."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "SIEM"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known benign similarly named files."
      - "Medium: Suspicious masquerading attempts."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious masquerading."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious masquerading."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but uncertain."
      - "Low: False positives."

ioc_types:
  - "File names matching legitimate binaries"
  - "Unsigned or invalid digital signatures"
  - "Hashes differing from known binaries"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect masqueraded binaries in non-standard paths"
    query: >
      file.name:("svchost.exe" OR "explorer.exe") AND NOT file.path:"C:\\Windows\\System32"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on execution of binaries with known names but unusual paths."
  - "Trigger hash and signature verification automatically."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate legitimate locations of binaries."
  - "Use threat intel to confirm malicious files."
  - "Review process behavior for persistence or lateral movement."

review_cycle: "Quarterly or after detection of new masquerading attempts"
