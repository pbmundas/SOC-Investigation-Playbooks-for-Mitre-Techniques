playbook_name: "T1059.001 - PowerShell Execution Detection"
tactic: "Execution"
technique_id: "T1059.001"
technique_name: "PowerShell"
description: >
  Detects adversary execution of PowerShell commands and scripts used for reconnaissance,
  execution, and lateral movement.

detection_sources:
  - PowerShell logs (Operational and Script Block Logging)
  - Sysmon process creation logs (EventID 1)
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect PowerShell Execution"
    description: >
      Monitor process creation events for PowerShell and analyze command line arguments.
    checklist:
      - "Look for powershell.exe and pwsh.exe process starts"
      - "Analyze command line for encoded commands, script blocks, or suspicious parameters"
      - "Check for bypass execution policies (e.g., -ExecutionPolicy Bypass)"
    data_sources:
      - "Sysmon EventID 1"
      - "PowerShell Operational Logs"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Investigate Suspicious PowerShell Commands"
    description: >
      Review commands for obfuscation, downloading payloads, or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Look for encoded base64 commands (-EncodedCommand)"
      - "Identify network connections initiated by PowerShell"
      - "Check for reflective loading or process injection"
    data_sources:
      - "PowerShell Script Block Logs"
      - "Network logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Response"
    description: >
      Respond to confirmed malicious PowerShell activity.
    checklist:
      - "Isolate endpoint"
      - "Disable affected accounts"
      - "Perform endpoint malware scans"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"

triage_labels:
  - severity:
      - "High: Malicious PowerShell activity confirmed"
      - "Medium: Suspicious PowerShell command detected"
  - confidence:
      - "High: Known malicious patterns"
      - "Medium: Obfuscated but unconfirmed"

ioc_types:
  - Process Name
  - Command Line
