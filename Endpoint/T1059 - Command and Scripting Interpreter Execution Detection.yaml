playbook_name: "T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter Execution Detection"
tactic: "Execution"
technique_id: "T1059"
technique_name: "Command and Scripting Interpreter"
description: >
  Detects adversary use of command line interfaces and scripting interpreters to execute commands
  for execution, persistence, or lateral movement.

detection_sources:
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  - Sysmon process creation logs (EventID 1)
  - PowerShell and command prompt logs
  - Windows Event Logs (e.g., Sysmon, Security)

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Command/Script Interpreter Execution"
    description: >
      Monitor process creation events for command line and script interpreters.
    checklist:
      - "Look for process creation events involving cmd.exe, powershell.exe, wscript.exe, cscript.exe, bash, sh, python, etc."
      - "Capture full command lines for suspicious or anomalous commands"
      - "Identify parent-child process relationships"
    data_sources:
      - "Sysmon EventID 1"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Command Line Activity"
    description: >
      Review commands executed for signs of malicious behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Look for encoded or obfuscated commands"
      - "Identify command chaining or execution of downloaders"
      - "Check for lateral movement or persistence commands"
    data_sources:
      - "Command line logs"
      - "Threat intelligence"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Response"
    description: >
      Take action based on investigation findings.
    checklist:
      - "Isolate affected host if malicious activity confirmed"
      - "Block or restrict suspicious accounts"
      - "Deploy endpoint remediation"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "Identity management"

triage_labels:
  - severity:
      - "Medium: Suspicious interpreter execution"
      - "High: Confirmed malicious commands"
  - confidence:
      - "High: Known malicious commands or behavior"
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed"
