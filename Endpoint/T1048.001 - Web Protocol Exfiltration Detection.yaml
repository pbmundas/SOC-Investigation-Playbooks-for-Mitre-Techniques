playbook_name: "T1048.001 - Web Protocol Exfiltration Detection"
tactic: "Exfiltration"
technique_id: "T1048.001"
technique_name: "Exfiltration Over Web Protocols"
description: >
  Detect exfiltration of data using common web protocols such as HTTP or HTTPS.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Outbound Web Traffic"
    description: >
      Identify large or anomalous data uploads over HTTP/HTTPS to external domains.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual volumes or frequencies of outbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic?"
      - "Is data sent to suspicious or rare domains?"
      - "Is there evidence of encoding, encryption, or obfuscation in the traffic?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "Proxy logs"
      - "Web gateway logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate with Endpoint Activity"
    description: >
      Check for processes involved in data staging or network communication over web protocols.
    checklist:
      - "Are there file compression or encryption operations prior to exfiltration?"
      - "Are unusual or unauthorized applications generating web traffic?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs"
      - "Process monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Analyze Domain and Certificate Reputation"
    description: >
      Validate destination domains and SSL/TLS certificates for legitimacy.
    checklist:
      - "Is the domain newly registered or uncommon?"
      - "Are certificates self-signed or from suspicious authorities?"
    data_sources:
      - "DNS logs"
      - "SSL/TLS inspection logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal business web traffic."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or anomalous traffic."
      - "High: Confirmed data exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified exfiltration events."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious external domains"
  - "Unusual SSL/TLS certificates"
  - "High-volume HTTP/HTTPS uploads"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Large HTTP POST Requests"
    query: >
      network.protocol = "HTTP" AND
      http.request_method = "POST" AND
      network.upload_bytes > threshold

  - name: "Identify Connections to New or Rare Domains"
    query: >
      dns.query_name NOT IN (known_good_domains) AND
      network.protocol IN ("HTTP", "HTTPS")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on high-volume HTTP POSTs to uncommon domains."
  - "Isolate endpoints with suspicious web traffic."
  - "Trigger forensic analysis."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if web protocol use is authorized."
  - "Investigate files or data involved."
  - "Engage incident response if confirmed."
