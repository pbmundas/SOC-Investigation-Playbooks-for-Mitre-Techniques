playbook_name: "T1204 - User Execution via Social Engineering on Lambda Functions"
tactic: "Execution"
technique_id: "T1204"
technique_name: "User Execution"
description: >
  Detect and investigate social engineering attempts aimed at tricking users or administrators
  into executing malicious AWS Lambda functions, potentially leading to privilege escalation,
  data compromise, or persistent access.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Creation and Invocation of Lambda Functions"
    description: >
      Track unusual creation or invocation of Lambda functions, especially those initiated
      by IAM users or roles not typically involved in Lambda management.
    checklist:
      - "Are there newly created Lambda functions with suspicious code or permissions?"
      - "Are Lambda functions being invoked by users outside of normal patterns?"
      - "Is there any evidence of phishing or social engineering campaigns targeting AWS credentials?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "AWS Lambda CloudWatch Logs"
      - "IAM Access Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Review Communication Channels for Social Engineering Indicators"
    description: >
      Analyze email, chat, or ticketing systems for evidence of phishing or manipulation attempts
      targeting AWS administrators or developers.
    checklist:
      - "Are there reports or logs of suspicious emails containing Lambda execution requests?"
      - "Is there any unusual access to support or internal communication systems?"
      - "Have credentials been requested or shared unusually?"
    data_sources:
      - "Email Security Logs"
      - "SIEM Alerts"
      - "Internal Communication Tools"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Validate Lambda Function Permissions and Code Integrity"
    description: >
      Check Lambda function configurations for over-permissive IAM roles and verify code
      integrity to detect inserted malicious payloads.
    checklist:
      - "Do Lambda execution roles have least privilege?"
      - "Is there any recent modification to Lambda function code without proper authorization?"
      - "Are environment variables or function triggers altered suspiciously?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS Config"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "Lambda Function Versioning"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Reported social engineering attempts without execution."
      - "Medium: Suspicious Lambda execution linked to social engineering."
      - "High: Confirmed execution of malicious Lambda functions due to social engineering."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified social engineering campaign causing Lambda misuse."
      - "Medium: Indicators of social engineering with inconclusive execution data."
      - "Low: Potential phishing with no confirmed impact."

ioc_types:
  - "Phishing emails targeting AWS credentials"
  - "Unexpected Lambda function creation or invocation"
  - "Altered Lambda permissions or environment variables"

    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventSource="iam.amazonaws.com" AND eventName IN ("AttachRolePolicy", "PutRolePolicy") AND resourceName LIKE "lambda%"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on Lambda creation or invocation from unusual users."
  - "Initiate MFA revalidation for accounts involved in suspicious Lambda activity."
  - "Trigger phishing awareness campaigns upon detection."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Correlate Lambda function events with known phishing or social engineering reports."
  - "Engage user education and password reset if compromise is suspected."
  - "Review and tighten IAM policies and Lambda execution roles."
