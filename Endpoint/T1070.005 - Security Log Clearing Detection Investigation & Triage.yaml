playbook_name: "T1070.005 - Security Log Clearing Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1070.005"
technique_name: "Security Log Clearing"
description: >
  Detect attempts to clear security event logs specifically to remove evidence of attacker activities.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Security Log Clearance Events"
    description: >
      Detect event log clearance focusing on security logs (Windows Security Event Log or equivalent).
    checklist:
      - "Are security logs cleared or truncated?"
      - "Are there events indicating log clearing like Event ID 1102?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Security Event Logs"
      - "Sysmon or endpoint monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Commands or API Usage"
    description: >
      Identify usage of tools or commands clearing security logs.
    checklist:
      - "Are commands like 'wevtutil' used to clear security logs?"
      - "Are API calls related to event log clearance detected?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process command line logs"
      - "API monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Malicious Events"
    description: >
      Investigate if clearing aligns with privilege escalation, malware execution, or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Is clearing closely timed with suspicious activities?"
      - "Are user accounts involved suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM logs"
      - "Endpoint telemetry"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Response Actions"
    description: >
      Isolate affected systems, restore logs if possible, and harden logging.
    checklist:
      - "Restore logs from backups."
      - "Review user privileges and access."
    data_sources:
      - "Backup tools"
      - "Incident response tools"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized security log clearing."
      - "Medium: Unexpected clearing requiring review."
      - "High: Malicious or unauthorized security log clearing."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed clearance of security logs."
      - "Medium: Suspicious activity detected."
      - "Low: Benign or scheduled maintenance."

ioc_types:
  - "Event ID 1102"
  - "wevtutil clear commands targeting security logs"
