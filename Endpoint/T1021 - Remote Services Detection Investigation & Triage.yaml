playbook_name: "T1021 - Remote Services Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Lateral Movement"
technique_id: "T1021"
technique_name: "Remote Services"
description: >
  Detects adversaries using remote services such as SSH, RDP, or SMB to move laterally across systems.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Use of Remote Service Protocols"
    description: >
      Monitor network connections and process activity involving remote service protocols (SSH, SMB, RDP).
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual or unauthorized remote connection attempts?"
      - "Is there use of remote services outside business hours or from unusual IPs?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Firewall logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Authentication Attempts Over Remote Services"
    description: >
      Monitor successful and failed login attempts via remote services.
    checklist:
      - "Are there repeated authentication failures?"
      - "Are successful logins from anomalous accounts or locations?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Remote service logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Remote Service Use with Lateral Movement Indicators"
    description: >
      Check for follow-up actions such as new process creations, file transfers, or privilege escalations.
    checklist:
      - "Is remote session followed by suspicious activity?"
      - "Are there signs of credential use or malware?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process logs"
      - "File access logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known and authorized remote sessions."
      - "Medium: Remote sessions outside normal patterns."
      - "High: Unauthorized or suspicious remote service use."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized remote connection."
      - "Medium: Unusual but unconfirmed remote service usage."
      - "Low: Routine remote administration."

ioc_types:
  - "Network connections on SSH (22), SMB (445), RDP (3389)"
  - "Remote login attempts or successes"
  - "Unexpected process launches following remote access"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect SSH Remote Sessions"
    query: >
      network.destination_port == 22 AND network.direction == "inbound"

  - name: "Detect SMB Remote Access"
    query: >
      network.destination_port == 445 AND network.direction == "inbound"

  - name: "Detect RDP Remote Access"
    query: >
      network.destination_port == 3389 AND network.direction == "inbound"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized remote service connections."
  - "Block suspicious IP addresses."
  - "Force re-authentication or account lockout on suspicious logins."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify legitimacy of remote access."
  - "Investigate post-connection activities."
  - "Implement stricter remote access controls."
