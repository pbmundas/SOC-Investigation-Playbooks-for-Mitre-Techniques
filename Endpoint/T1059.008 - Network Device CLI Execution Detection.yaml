  - AAA logs (TACACS+, RADIUS)

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify CLI Access Events"
    checklist:

      - "Determine if privilege escalation occurred"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Remediation"
    checklist:
      - "Revoke compromised credentials"
      - "Restore device config from backup if altered"
      - "Search for lateral movement or device pivoting"

triage_labels:

  - confidence: High
