playbook_name: "T1552.004 - Private Key Credential Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1552.004"
technique_name: "Private Keys"
description: >
  Detects exposure or misuse of private key files used for SSH or API access that can be leveraged by adversaries.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Access to Private Key Files"
    description: >
      Monitor access to files with extensions or names related to private keys (e.g., id_rsa, *.pem).
    checklist:
      - "Who accessed the private key file?"
      - "Was it read, moved, or transmitted externally?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Process file access logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Validate File Contents"
    description: >
      Confirm presence of private key content based on header/footer and PEM format.
    checklist:
      - "Does the file contain 'BEGIN PRIVATE KEY' or similar?"
      - "Is it encrypted or plaintext?"
    data_sources:
      - "File content inspection"
      - "DLP or endpoint scanning tools"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Check for Usage in SSH Sessions or API Access"
    description: >
      Determine if the key was used for outbound connections.
    checklist:
      - "Any SSH sessions or API calls using the key?"
      - "Is there lateral movement or remote command execution?"
    data_sources:
      - "SSH logs"
      - "Network proxy/API gateway logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Encrypted or inactive key file accessed."
      - "Medium: Unencrypted key accessed but unused."
      - "High: Private key accessed and used for external connections."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Active usage of accessed private key."
      - "Medium: Plaintext private key found on disk."
      - "Low: Access by known safe process."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to ~/.ssh/id_rsa or .pem files"
  - "Key file sent via email or upload"
  - "Use of private key for SSH from unusual IP"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Private Key File Access"
    query: >
      file.path MATCHES ("(?i)(id_rsa|\\.pem|\\.key)$") AND
      event.type == "file_read"

  - name: "SSH Session Initiated with Private Key"
    query: >
      process.command_line CONTAINS ("ssh -i") AND
      destination.ip NOT IN (internal_ranges)

automation_hooks:
  - "Flag plaintext private key files on disk."
  - "Alert on use of keys from unusual hosts."
  - "Trigger credential revocation or SSH key rotation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate whether the private key is still valid or revoked."
  - "Notify asset owner and perform key hygiene audit."
  - "Recommend storing keys securely (e.g., ssh-agent, vaults)."
