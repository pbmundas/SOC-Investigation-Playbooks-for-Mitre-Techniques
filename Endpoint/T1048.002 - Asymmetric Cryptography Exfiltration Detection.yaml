technique_name: "Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Cryptography"
description: >
  Detect data exfiltration via encrypted communication using asymmetric cryptography methods.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Encrypted Traffic for Anomalies"
    description: >
      Identify encrypted outbound traffic that deviates from normal patterns, especially with new or unknown keys.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual encrypted sessions or key exchanges?"
      - "Is encrypted traffic sent to uncommon or suspicious endpoints?"
      - "Are cryptographic keys or certificates newly generated?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic and TLS inspection logs"
      - "Key management and certificate logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Endpoint Cryptographic Operations"
    description: >
      Check processes for asymmetric encryption usage tied to data exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Are files encrypted or prepared with public/private keys?"
      - "Are suspicious or unauthorized cryptographic tools running?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Review Key Exchange and Certificate Usage"
    description: >
      Validate the legitimacy of keys and certificates used in communication.
    checklist:
      - "Are there self-signed or otherwise suspicious certificates?"
      - "Are keys rotated unusually frequently?"
    data_sources:
      - "Certificate management systems"
      - "Network monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate encrypted communication."
      - "Medium: Anomalous cryptographic use."
      - "High: Confirmed exfiltration via asymmetric encryption."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious encrypted data transfer."
      - "Medium: Suspicious cryptographic behavior."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Unusual certificate or key usage"
  - "Anomalous encrypted network sessions"
  - "Unauthorized cryptographic tools/processes"
