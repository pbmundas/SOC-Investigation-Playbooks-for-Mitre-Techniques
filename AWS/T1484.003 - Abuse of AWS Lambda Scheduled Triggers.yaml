description: >
  Detect unauthorized or malicious modification of AWS Lambda scheduled triggers
  such as CloudWatch Events, EventBridge, or Step Functions that execute Lambda functions for persistence or execution of malicious payloads.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Changes to Lambda Scheduled Triggers"
    description: >
      Monitor creation, update, or deletion of Lambda triggers tied to scheduled events.
    checklist:
      - "Are Lambda triggers created or modified by unexpected users or roles?"
      - "Is trigger frequency or target Lambda unusual?"
      - "Is the trigger associated with a known compromised resource?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "AWS Config"
      - "Lambda Function Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Triggered Lambda Execution"
    description: >
      Examine execution logs for unusual or suspicious activity during Lambda runs initiated by scheduled triggers.
    checklist:
      - "Is there execution of unusual commands or network calls?"
      - "Are environment variables or function code modified during execution?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudWatch Logs"
      - "Lambda Execution Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Scheduled triggers matching deployment automation."
      - "Medium: New or unsanctioned trigger creations or updates."
      - "High: Suspicious Lambda executions tied to scheduled triggers."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Direct evidence of malicious payload or persistence."
      - "Medium: Trigger change without clear malicious activity."
      - "Low: Routine automation."

ioc_types:
  - "PutRule or PutTargets API calls for Lambda triggers"
  - "Lambda executions outside normal schedule or baseline"
  - "Modification of Lambda environment variables or code by unauthorized principals"
