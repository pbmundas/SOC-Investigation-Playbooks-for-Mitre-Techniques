playbook_name: "T1560.004 - Archive via Encryption Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1560.004"
technique_name: "Archive via Encryption"
description: >
  Detects adversaries encrypting collected data prior to exfiltration to evade detection and protect data confidentiality.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Use of Encryption Utilities or Commands"
    description: >
      Identify execution of encryption tools or commands (e.g., openssl, gpg, ccrypt) on collected data.
    checklist:
      - "Are encryption utilities executed by unusual users or processes?"
      - "Is encryption applied immediately after data collection or staging?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command line auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor Creation of Encrypted Files"
    description: >
      Detect creation of files with encrypted formats or extensions (e.g., .gpg, .enc, .aes).
    checklist:
      - "Are encrypted files created in sensitive or uncommon directories?"
      - "Is there a pattern of encrypted file creation after data staging?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Process monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Encryption Activity with Data Exfiltration Attempts"
    description: >
      Investigate if encrypted files are being moved or transmitted externally after creation.
    checklist:
      - "Is outbound network traffic occurring after encrypted file creation?"
      - "Are destination IPs or domains suspicious or unknown?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "SIEM correlation"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Encryption used for legitimate backups or compliance."
      - "Medium: Suspicious encryption activity without confirmed exfiltration."
      - "High: Encryption linked to unauthorized data exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified encryption followed by data transfer."
      - "Medium: Suspicious encryption behavior."
      - "Low: Legitimate encryption usage."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of encryption tools like openssl, gpg"
  - "Creation of encrypted files (.gpg, .enc, .aes)"
  - "Outbound transfer of encrypted files"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Encryption Utility Execution"
    query: >
      process.name IN ("openssl", "gpg", "ccrypt") AND
      user.name NOT IN ("backup", "admin")

  - name: "Encrypted File Creation"
    query: >
      file.extension IN (".gpg", ".enc", ".aes") AND
      process.parent.name IN ("openssl", "gpg", "ccrypt")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on encryption utility usage by unauthorized users."
  - "Block suspicious encrypted file transfers."
  - "Notify security operations for investigation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if encryption activity is authorized."
  - "Investigate user and process context."
  - "Check network traffic destinations and timing."
