playbook_name: "T1036.006 - Parent Process Masquerading Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1036.006"
technique_name: "Masquerading: Parent Process"
description: >
  Detect adversaries manipulating parent process information to hide malicious activity.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Parent-Child Process Relationships"
    description: >
      Identify anomalies in parent process IDs or unusual parent-child process combinations.
    checklist:
      - "Are critical system processes spawned by unexpected parents?"
      - "Is the parent process ID spoofed or inconsistent?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring logs"
      - "Endpoint detection and response (EDR)"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Verify Legitimate Parent Process"
    description: >
      Confirm that parent processes are legitimate and not masqueraded.
    checklist:
      - "Is the parent process a signed system binary?"
      - "Does the parent process execution context align with expected behavior?"
    data_sources:
      - "File integrity and signature logs"
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Investigate Suspicious Parent-Child Process Chains"
    description: >
      Analyze process chains for signs of masquerading or process hollowing.
    checklist:
      - "Are there processes hiding under legitimate parents?"
      - "Are child processes performing suspicious activities?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR telemetry"
      - "Process lineage analysis"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Mitigate"
    description: >
      Terminate malicious processes and block parent process manipulation.
    checklist:
      - "Kill malicious child processes."
      - "Deploy detection rules for parent process anomalies."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint protection"
      - "SIEM"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Unusual but explainable parent-child relations."
      - "Medium: Suspicious process parent manipulation."
      - "High: Confirmed parent process masquerading."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed spoofing."
      - "Medium: Indicators present."
      - "Low: False positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Inconsistent parent process IDs"
  - "Unsigned or suspicious parent processes"
  - "Unexpected process chains"
