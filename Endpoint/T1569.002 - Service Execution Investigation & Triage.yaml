technique_name: "Service Execution"
description: >
  Investigation-centric playbook for identifying, triaging, and responding to adversary use of
  service-related mechanisms (like sc.exe or systemctl) to execute malicious binaries.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Initial Alert Review"
    description: >
      Determine whether service-related activity was initiated by a user or script and whether itâ€™s legitimate.
    checklist:
      - "Was 'sc.exe', 'New-Service', or 'systemctl' executed?"
      - "What is the name and path of the binary being registered?"
      - "Who initiated the service creation (user account, session origin)?"
      - "Is the binary in a suspicious location (e.g., temp, user folder)?"
    data_sources:
      - "Sysmon Event ID 7045"
      - "Windows Security Logs"
      - "Auditd Logs"
      - "SIEM Alerts"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Binary and Command Analysis"
    description: >
      Analyze the service configuration and binary attributes for signs of tampering or malicious behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Does the binary have unusual metadata (signed, created time, known hash)?"
      - "Are arguments passed to the binary unusual or obfuscated?"
      - "Was the same binary used elsewhere in the environment?"
    data_sources:
      - "File Metadata"
      - "Binary Reputation via Threat Intelligence"
      - "Sysmon FileCreate Events"
      - "Process Command-Line Arguments"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Execution and Lateral Movement Check"
    description: >
      Confirm whether the service was used to run a malicious process or move laterally.
    checklist:
      - "Was the binary executed post service creation?"
      - "Did the host generate unusual network connections afterward?"
      - "Were other systems targeted via SMB, RDP, or WMI from this host?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR Process Tree"
      - "Firewall or NetFlow Logs"
      - "Sysmon ProcessCreate"
      - "Remote Service Management Logs"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Persistence or Privilege Escalation Validation"
    description: >
      Validate if the service was intended for persistence or privilege escalation.
    checklist:
      - "Was the service set to AutoStart or Manual?"
      - "Is it listed in known persistence registry keys?"
      - "Does the service run under SYSTEM or elevated account?"
    data_sources:
      - "Registry Keys"
      - "Service Configuration"
      - "Access Token Analysis"
      - "Startup Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known internal tool or service with benign binary."
      - "Medium: Custom service with suspicious or uncommon name or path."
      - "High: Confirmed use of malicious binary or lateral movement post execution."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Binary hash or behavior matches malware/known threat."
      - "Medium: Unknown binary, odd path or service name."
      - "Low: Legitimate tool with rare usage pattern."

ioc_types:
  - "Service name"
  - "Binary path and hash"
  - "Command-line arguments"
  - "User account initiating change"
  - "Remote IPs accessed post-execution"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Suspicious Service Creation"
    query: >
      event.code:7045 AND (service.binary_path:*\\temp\\* OR service.binary_path:*\\users\\*)
  - name: "SC.exe Usage by Script"
    query: >
      process.name:sc.exe AND parent_process.name:(powershell.exe OR cmd.exe OR wscript.exe)
  - name: "New Services with Unusual Names"
    query: >
      event.code:7045 AND NOT service.name:(known_safe_service_names)

automation_hooks:
  - "Auto-enrich binary with VT/hash reputation"
  - "Tag alert with MITRE T1569.002 and mark as suspicious if location is unusual"
  - "Auto-disable service and alert IR team if severity=High"
  - "Run retrohunt for same binary on other endpoints"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Check user context and remote login history for the system."
  - "Validate whether binary is signed and used elsewhere in your environment."
  - "If executable is unknown, isolate the host and extract for sandboxing."
  - "Investigate lateral movement post service creation to assess impact."
