playbook_name: "T1550 - Alternate Authentication Material Usage Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1550"
technique_name: "Use Alternate Authentication Material"
description: >
  Detects usage of alternate authentication materials like tokens, tickets, or keys to access accounts or systems.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Use of Kerberos Tickets or Tokens"
    description: >
      Monitor for unusual use or creation of Kerberos tickets (e.g., Golden Tickets, Silver Tickets).
    checklist:
      - "Are there Kerberos tickets created outside normal user activity?"
      - "Are ticket lifetimes or privilege levels unusual?"
    data_sources:
      - "Kerberos authentication logs"
      - "Security event logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Usage of Other Authentication Artifacts"
    description: >
      Detect use of alternate credentials such as OAuth tokens, API keys, or SSH keys for authentication.
    checklist:
      - "Are OAuth tokens used from unexpected sources or with anomalous frequency?"
      - "Are SSH keys used for access outside normal patterns?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "API gateway logs"
      - "SSH access logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Authentication Material Usage with Suspicious Access"
    description: >
      Check if use of alternate authentication material results in access to sensitive resources.
    checklist:
      - "Is there access to high-value resources post alternate auth usage?"
      - "Are these accesses consistent with user roles and times?"
    data_sources:
      - "Access logs"
      - "User activity monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate alternate auth material use."
      - "Medium: Unusual use without confirmed malicious activity."
      - "High: Unauthorized use leading to sensitive resource access."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed use of forged or stolen authentication materials."
      - "Medium: Anomalous use patterns."
      - "Low: Normal use but flagged due to anomalies."

ioc_types:
  - "Unusual Kerberos ticket requests or renewals"
  - "OAuth or API tokens used from new or untrusted locations"
  - "SSH key usage outside baseline behavior"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Abnormal Kerberos Ticket Usage"
    query: >
      event.type == "kerberos_ticket_request" AND
      ticket.lifetime > normal_threshold AND
      user.name NOT IN (trusted_accounts)

  - name: "Detect OAuth Token Use from Untrusted IP"
    query: >
      event.type == "oauth_token_use" AND
      source.ip NOT IN (trusted_ip_ranges)

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious authentication material use."
  - "Revoke or reset tokens and keys upon detection."
  - "Force re-authentication and credential rotation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review token lifetimes and issuance contexts."
  - "Validate all authentication material against inventory."
  - "Recommend restricting use and monitoring of privileged tokens."
