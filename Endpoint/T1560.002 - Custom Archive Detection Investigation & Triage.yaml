playbook_name: "T1560.002 - Custom Archive Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1560.002"
technique_name: "Custom Archive"
description: >
  Detects adversaries using custom or less common archive/compression methods or tools for data collection and exfiltration.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Execution of Unknown or Custom Archiving Tools"
    description: >
      Detect processes or scripts invoking non-standard or custom archiving/compression utilities.
    checklist:
      - "Are unknown or unsigned binaries performing archive-related activities?"
      - "Are there scripts compressing or bundling files unusually?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs"
      - "File system activity monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Creation of Non-Standard Archive Files"
    description: >
      Look for creation of archive files with uncommon extensions or temporary files used in custom archiving.
    checklist:
      - "Are archive-like files created with uncommon extensions?"
      - "Is file content indicative of compression or bundling?"
    data_sources:
      - "File metadata analysis"
      - "Content inspection"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Custom Archive Activity with Suspicious Behavior"
    description: >
      Investigate if custom archive creation aligns with unusual data access or network exfiltration attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Is custom archive creation followed by outbound network connections?"
      - "Are involved processes or users anomalous?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "User activity monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Custom archive tools used by authorized users."
      - "Medium: Unusual custom archive activity."
      - "High: Malicious custom archive creation linked to exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified custom archive followed by data exfiltration."
      - "Medium: Detection of suspicious custom archive creation."
      - "Low: Normal use of less common archiving utilities."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of unknown or custom compression binaries"
  - "Creation of archive files with uncommon extensions"
  - "Outbound transfer of custom archive files"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Unknown Archive Utility Execution"
    query: >
      process.name NOT IN ("zip", "tar", "rar", "7z", "gzip") AND
      process.command_line MATCHES ("archive|compress|bundle")

  - name: "Non-Standard Archive File Creation"
    query: >
      file.extension NOT IN (".zip", ".rar", ".7z", ".tar", ".gz") AND
      file.size > 100MB AND
      file.creation_time > now() - 1h

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unknown archive tool execution."
  - "Isolate suspicious processes or endpoints."
  - "Notify security team for investigation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if custom archiving is authorized."
  - "Investigate process origin and user context."
  - "Monitor for follow-on exfiltration activity."
