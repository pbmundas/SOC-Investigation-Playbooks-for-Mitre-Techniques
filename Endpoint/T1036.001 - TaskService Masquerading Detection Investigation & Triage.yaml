playbook_name: "T1036.001 - Task/Service Masquerading Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1036.001"
technique_name: "Task/Service Masquerading"
description: >
  Detect adversaries masquerading malicious tasks or services as legitimate ones by using trusted names or locations.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Enumerate Scheduled Tasks and Services"
    description: >
      Identify scheduled tasks or services with suspicious names, locations, or configurations.
    checklist:
      - "Are there tasks/services with names matching legitimate ones but different executable paths?"
      - "Are task descriptions or service descriptions unusual or missing?"
      - "Are scheduled tasks/services created or modified recently without authorization?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Task Scheduler logs"
      - "Service control manager logs"
      - "Configuration management systems"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Validate Executable Paths and Signatures"
    description: >
      Verify that executables launched by tasks/services are legitimate and signed.
    checklist:
      - "Do executables run from expected directories?"
      - "Are digital signatures valid?"
      - "Are hashes consistent with known good files?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system scans"
      - "Digital signature logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Monitor Behavior of Tasks and Services"
    description: >
      Detect suspicious behavior such as unexpected network connections, privilege escalations, or process spawning.
    checklist:
      - "Do tasks/services spawn unexpected child processes?"
      - "Is there unusual network activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process and network monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Remediate"
    description: >
      Disable or remove suspicious tasks/services and strengthen monitoring.
    checklist:
      - "Disable unauthorized tasks/services."
      - "Set alerts for future suspicious creations."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "SIEM alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known benign tasks/services."
      - "Medium: Suspicious masquerading tasks/services."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious masquerading."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious tasks/services."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed."
      - "Low: Known benign anomalies."

ioc_types:
  - "Scheduled tasks or services with spoofed names"
  - "Executables running from unusual paths"
  - "Unsigned or invalid signatures"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect scheduled tasks running executables from unusual paths"
    query: >
      task.path NOT IN ["C:\\Windows\\System32\\", "C:\\Program Files\\"]

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on creation or modification of tasks/services with suspicious attributes."
  - "Trigger signature and hash validation upon detection."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Cross-check task/service legitimacy with system baselines."
  - "Investigate process behavior spawned by tasks/services."
  - "Confirm if recent changes were authorized."

review_cycle: "Quarterly or after suspicious task/service detections"
