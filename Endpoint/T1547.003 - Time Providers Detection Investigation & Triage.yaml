playbook_name: "T1547.003 - Time Providers Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1547.003"
technique_name: "Time Providers"
description: >
  Detect adversaries who modify or replace time providers to maintain persistence or disrupt system time-related defenses.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Time Provider Service and DLL Changes"
    description: >
      Detect modifications or additions of time provider services or DLLs.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new or modified files related to time services (e.g., W32Time)?"
      - "Are services registered or altered with suspicious parameters?"
      - "Are any DLLs loaded by time services unsigned or new?"
    data_sources:
      - "Service creation and modification logs"
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "DLL load events"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Abnormal Time Synchronization Behavior"
    description: >
      Investigate unexpected changes in system time or synchronization sources.
    checklist:
      - "Are system clocks adjusted unexpectedly?"
      - "Are time syncs performed with untrusted sources?"
      - "Are there logs of frequent or anomalous time changes?"
    data_sources:
      - "System event logs"
      - "Time sync logs"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Suspicious Activities"
    description: >
      Link time provider modifications to other persistence or evasion techniques.
    checklist:
      - "Are time provider changes correlated with suspicious process or network activity?"
      - "Is there evidence of defense evasion or log tampering?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process and network monitoring"
      - "Security logs"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate Legitimacy of Time Provider Changes"
    description: >
      Confirm whether changes are authorized or part of system updates.
    checklist:
      - "Are changes explained by patches or legitimate admin actions?"
      - "Are endpoint protections enabled?"
    data_sources:
      - "Patch and change management"
      - "EDR alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized time provider updates."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed changes."
      - "High: Malicious time provider modifications detected."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known malicious DLL or service hashes."
      - "Medium: Anomalous but unverified changes."
      - "Low: Legitimate updates."

ioc_types:
  - "Modified or new time provider DLL hashes"
  - "Service creation/modification events"
  - "System time change events"
  - "Suspicious time synchronization sources"

queries/examples:
  - name: "New or Modified Time Provider DLLs"
    query: >
      file.path:"C:\\Windows\\System32\\w32time.dll" AND
      event.action:("file_created" OR "file_modified")
  - name: "Service Creation or Modification of Time Providers"
    query: >
      event.provider:"Service Control Manager" AND
      event.action:("service_created" OR "service_modified") AND
      service.name:"W32Time"
  - name: "Unexpected System Time Changes"
    query: >
      event.id:4616

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized changes to time provider services or DLLs"
  - "Block suspicious DLL loads by time services"
  - "Notify on unexpected system time changes"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate changes with IT or patch management."
  - "Review logs for suspicious time changes."
  - "Check for correlated malicious activity."
  - "Consult threat intelligence."
