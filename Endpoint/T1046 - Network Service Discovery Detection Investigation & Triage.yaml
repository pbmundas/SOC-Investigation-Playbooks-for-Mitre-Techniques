playbook_name: "T1046 - Network Service Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1046"
technique_name: "Network Service Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries scanning and enumerating network services to identify open ports, protocols, and services for further exploitation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Network Scanning and Enumeration Tools"
    description: >
      Identify use of tools like `nmap`, `netstat`, `ss`, or PowerShell cmdlets performing network scans.
    checklist:
      - "Are network scan tools executed from endpoints or servers?"
      - "Is scanning activity abnormal in volume or timing?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Network flow/log data"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Unusual Network Scanning Patterns"
    description: >
      Look for high frequency or broad range port scans originating from suspicious hosts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there scans against multiple IPs or subnets?"
      - "Is scan traffic observed from non-administrative accounts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Firewall logs"
      - "IDS/IPS alerts"
      - "Network flow telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Scanning with Other Intrusion Activities"
    description: >
      Determine if scanning activity precedes exploitation, lateral movement, or data access.
    checklist:
      - "Is scanning activity followed by suspicious connections or process creation?"
      - "Are credential use or privilege escalation attempts detected afterward?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection logs"
      - "Authentication logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Scanning activity from authorized network tools."
      - "Medium: Scanning by unusual users or systems."
      - "High: Scanning linked to active intrusion or reconnaissance."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified unauthorized network scanning."
      - "Medium: Suspicious scanning behavior."
      - "Low: Routine network diagnostics."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of nmap, masscan, or similar tools"
  - "PowerShell network scan cmdlets"
  - "High volume SYN or port scan packets"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect nmap Command Execution"
    query: >
      process.name == "nmap.exe" OR process.command_line CONTAINS "nmap"

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Port Scanning"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Test-NetConnection|PortScan"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized network scanning."
  - "Throttle or block scanning traffic from endpoints."
  - "Investigate scanning hosts for compromise."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify source and purpose of network scanning."
  - "Correlate with follow-up attack activity."
  - "Implement network segmentation and monitoring."
