playbook_name: "T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact on S3 Buckets or EBS Volumes"
tactic: "Impact"
technique_id: "T1486"
technique_name: "Data Encrypted for Impact"
description: >
  Detect ransomware or malicious activity encrypting data stored in AWS services such as S3 buckets or
  EBS volumes, causing disruption or denial of access.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Unusual Changes or Encryption on S3 Buckets"
    description: >
      Detect sudden or mass changes in S3 object encryption status, deletions, or object replacements.
    checklist:
      - "Are there bulk object modifications or replacements?"
      - "Is encryption status changing unexpectedly?"
      - "Are deletion events occurring in clusters?"
    data_sources:
      - "S3 Access Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "AWS Config"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Encryption or Modification of EBS Volumes"
    description: >
      Review AWS CloudTrail and EBS snapshots for unexpected encryption, deletion, or snapshot creation patterns.
    checklist:
      - "Are EBS volumes being encrypted or deleted without change control?"
      - "Are snapshots created in suspicious patterns or by unknown users?"
      - "Is there evidence of mounting volumes on compromised instances?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "AWS Config"
      - "EC2 Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Ransomware or Malicious Activity"
    description: >
      Investigate indicators of ransomware execution such as suspicious Lambda functions, EC2 processes,
      or IAM changes enabling such impact.
    checklist:
      - "Are there signs of ransomware binaries or scripts running on EC2 or Lambda?"
      - "Is there privilege escalation or suspicious IAM policy changes?"
      - "Are alerting mechanisms detecting ransom notes or unusual file extensions?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "IAM Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Planned or authorized encryption activities."
      - "Medium: Unusual encryption changes needing validation."
      - "High: Confirmed ransomware encryption impacting data availability."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified ransomware or malicious encryption event."
      - "Medium: Suspicious encryption with incomplete confirmation."
      - "Low: Routine encryption or backup activities."

ioc_types:
  - "Mass S3 object encryption or deletion events"
  - "Unexpected EBS volume encryption or deletion"
  - "Suspicious processes or scripts on EC2 or Lambda linked to encryption"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on bulk S3 encryption or deletion events outside of maintenance windows."
  - "Trigger automated snapshot backups and isolate compromised EC2 instances."
  - "Revoke or rotate IAM keys involved in suspicious encryption activities."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if encryption activity aligns with backup or compliance processes."
  - "Correlate with ransomware indicators or compromise evidence."
  - "Recommend incident response steps including recovery and remediation."
