playbook_name: "T1547.004 - Winlogon Helper DLL Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1547.004"
technique_name: "Winlogon Helper DLL"
description: >
  Detect adversaries who install malicious DLLs loaded by Winlogon to maintain persistence during user logon.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify New or Modified Winlogon Helper DLLs"
    description: >
      Monitor DLLs registered under Winlogon key locations in the registry.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new or modified DLLs in HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Notify?"
      - "Are DLLs signed and trusted?"
      - "Are file hashes known or suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "Registry monitoring"
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect DLL Loading by Winlogon Process"
    description: >
      Observe Winlogon.exe process loading DLLs and any abnormal child processes or behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Are unauthorized DLLs loaded by Winlogon?"
      - "Is Winlogon spawning suspicious processes?"
      - "Is there abnormal network activity tied to Winlogon?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process and DLL load logs"
      - "Network monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with User Logon Events and Suspicious Activity"
    description: >
      Investigate suspicious user logons or system events around DLL modifications.
    checklist:
      - "Are there failed or suspicious logon attempts?"
      - "Are persistence or lateral movement artifacts detected?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Security Event Logs"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate Changes with Patch and Change Management"
    description: >
      Confirm whether DLL changes or registrations are authorized.
    checklist:
      - "Is there a legitimate patch or update explaining the DLL?"
      - "Are endpoint protections and AV active?"
    data_sources:
      - "Change management logs"
      - "EDR status"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized or known Winlogon helper DLLs."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unverified DLLs."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious Winlogon helper DLL detected."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known malware or suspicious hashes."
      - "Medium: Unsigned or anomalous DLL but no clear impact."
      - "Low: Known benign DLL updates."

queries/examples:
  - name: "New or Modified Winlogon Notify DLL Registry Entries"
    query: >
