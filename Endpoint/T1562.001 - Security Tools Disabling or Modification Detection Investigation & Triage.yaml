tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1562.001"
technique_name: "Disable or Modify Tools"
description: >
  Detect attempts to disable or reconfigure security tools such as antivirus or endpoint protection software.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor AV/EDR Registry & Policy Modifications"
    description: >
      Look for registry changes to security software keys.
    checklist:
      - "Are Defender policies set to ignore threats?"
      - "Was real-time monitoring disabled?"
    data_sources:
      - "Registry auditing"
      - "Defender logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Tampering with Agent Services"
    description: >
      Identify if security agent services were disabled or set to manual.
    checklist:
      - "Did service configuration change?"
      - "Was the agent uninstalled or stopped?"
    data_sources:
      - "Service control manager logs"
      - "Process creation logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate With Threat Signatures"
    description: >
      Match changes to known attacker procedures.
    checklist:
      - "Is the modification consistent with known malware?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat detection platforms"
      - "Memory analysis"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: User misconfiguration."
      - "Medium: Unexpected policy changes."
      - "High: Confirmed tool disablement by threat."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches adversary TTPs."
      - "Medium: Behavioral suspicion."
      - "Low: No follow-up anomalies."

ioc_types:
  - "Registry keys for Defender, AV/EDR"
  - "Service status changes"
