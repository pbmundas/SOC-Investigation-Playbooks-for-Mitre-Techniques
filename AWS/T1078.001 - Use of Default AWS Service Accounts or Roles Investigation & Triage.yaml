description: >
  Detect usage of default or built-in AWS service accounts or roles that attackers may abuse to gain persistent access to AWS resources.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Usage of Default or Built-in AWS Service Accounts and Roles"
    description: >
      Monitor AWS CloudTrail logs and IAM activity for usage of default AWS service accounts or roles, especially those rarely or never used in normal operations.
    checklist:
      - "Are default service roles being assumed or accessed unexpectedly?"
      - "Is there usage of AWS managed policies or roles without recent history?"
      - "Is a service account performing unusual API calls or actions?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail logs"
      - "AWS IAM Access Advisor"
      - "AWS Config"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Anomalous or Unauthorized API Calls by Service Accounts"
    description: >
      Look for API calls made by service accounts or roles that deviate from their normal patterns or scope.
    checklist:
      - "Are service accounts accessing resources outside their expected scope?"
      - "Are there unusual actions like creation or modification of IAM roles or policies?"
      - "Is there API usage outside business hours or from unexpected IP addresses?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail event logs"
      - "AWS VPC Flow Logs"
      - "AWS IAM Access Advisor"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Indicators of Compromise"
    description: >
      Combine detection of default account usage with other suspicious activities such as privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or deployment of resources.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of privilege escalation following service account use?"
      - "Are there unusual resource provisioning or network connections?"
      - "Is there a sudden increase in data downloads or external connections?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail logs"
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "S3 access logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Default account usage in line with normal operations."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or rare usage of default roles or accounts."
      - "High: Unauthorized or malicious use of default service accounts leading to privilege escalation or data access."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear logs showing unexpected default account usage with suspicious activity."
      - "Medium: Default account used outside normal patterns but no direct malicious actions observed."
      - "Low: Possible false positives due to legitimate automation or scheduled tasks."

ioc_types:
  - "AWS default service role assumption events"
  - "Unusual API calls by default service accounts"
  - "Suspicious IP addresses associated with service account activity"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on assumption of default AWS service roles from unusual IPs or locations."
  - "Automatically revoke suspicious role sessions pending investigation."
  - "Trigger incident response workflow on confirmed abuse of default service accounts."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if default account usage aligns with legitimate AWS service operations or automation."
  - "Investigate any unexpected role assumptions for potential compromise."
  - "Review permissions granted to default roles and tighten if necessary."
  - "Contain and remediate compromised accounts or roles quickly."
