playbook_name: "T1027 - Obfuscation or Encoding Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1027"
technique_name: "Obfuscation or Encoding"
description: >
  Detect adversaries using obfuscation or encoding to hide malicious payloads or evade detection.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Obfuscated Scripts or Files"
    description: >
      Scan scripts, binaries, and network traffic for encoded or obfuscated content.
    checklist:
      - "Are there base64, hex, or custom-encoded strings?"
      - "Is PowerShell or script content heavily obfuscated?"
    data_sources:
      - "File scans"
      - "Network traffic inspection"
      - "EDR script monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Deobfuscate and Analyze Content"
    description: >
      Use decoding tools to reveal actual payload or commands.
    checklist:
      - "Can obfuscated content be decoded?"
      - "Does decoded content contain malicious commands or code?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence tools"
      - "Decoding scripts"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Monitor Execution of Obfuscated Code"
    description: >
      Detect runtime behavior indicative of obfuscation usage.
    checklist:
      - "Are scripts executed with unusual parameters?"
      - "Do obfuscated scripts spawn suspicious processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Mitigate"
    description: >
      Block or quarantine obfuscated files and monitor sources.
    checklist:
      - "Prevent execution of detected obfuscated scripts."
      - "Alert on repeat occurrences from same origin."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint protection"
      - "SIEM"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Obfuscation used in legitimate contexts."
      - "Medium: Suspicious obfuscation without confirmed maliciousness."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious obfuscation."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Decoded malicious content."
      - "Medium: Indicators present."
      - "Low: False positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Encoded scripts or payloads"
  - "Suspicious PowerShell commands"
  - "Unusual network encoding"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect base64 encoded commands in PowerShell"
    query: >
      process.name:"powershell.exe" AND process.command_line:*base64*

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on execution of encoded scripts."
  - "Block execution of scripts from untrusted sources."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Analyze decoded content carefully."
  - "Correlate with threat intel and other detections."
