playbook_name: "T1110 - Brute Force Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1110"
technique_name: "Brute Force"
description: >
  Detects repeated attempts to gain access to accounts by systematically trying passwords or keys.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Repeated Authentication Failures"
    description: >
      Detect multiple failed login attempts within a short timeframe targeting the same account or IP.
    checklist:
      - "Are there bursts of failed login attempts?"
      - "Is the source IP or account unusual or blacklisted?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Firewall logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate Successful Logins After Failures"
    description: >
      Check if a successful login occurs immediately after multiple failures.
    checklist:
      - "Was the successful login from the same IP or user?"
      - "Does the login correlate with unusual activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "User activity logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Identify Tools or Scripts Used for Brute Force"
    description: >
      Detect presence or execution of brute force tools or automated scripts on hosts.
    checklist:
      - "Are known brute force tool signatures detected?"
      - "Is there unusual network scanning or connection attempts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection logs"
      - "Network IDS/IPS"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Few failed attempts with no success."
      - "Medium: Multiple failed attempts, no success yet."
      - "High: Successful login after multiple failures."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed brute force tool usage."
      - "Medium: Multiple failed attempts from suspicious sources."
      - "Low: Isolated failed attempts."

ioc_types:
  - "Multiple failed authentication attempts"
  - "Known brute force tool processes"
  - "Unusual login success patterns"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Multiple Failed Login Attempts"
    query: >
      event.type == "authentication_failure" AND
      count() BY source.ip WITHIN 5 minutes > 10

  - name: "Successful Login After Failures"
    query: >
      event.type == "authentication_success" AND
      previous_event.type == "authentication_failure" AND
      source.ip == previous_event.source.ip AND
      timestamp - previous_event.timestamp < 1 minute

automation_hooks:
  - "Throttle or block source IP after repeated failures."
  - "Alert security team on potential brute force attempts."
  - "Lock accounts after threshold exceeded."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review login patterns and affected accounts."
  - "Check for lateral movement or privilege escalation."
  - "Recommend enforcing MFA and strong password policies."
