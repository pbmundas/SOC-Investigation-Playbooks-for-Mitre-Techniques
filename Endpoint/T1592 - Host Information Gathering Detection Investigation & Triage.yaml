playbook_name: "T1592 - Host Information Gathering Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1592"
technique_name: "Gather Victim Host Information"
description: >
  Detects adversaries collecting detailed host information such as system configuration, installed software, or hardware details to tailor further attacks.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect System and Hardware Information Queries"
    description: >
      Monitor commands and tools used to gather system info (e.g., systeminfo, hostname, uname, WMI queries).
    checklist:
      - "Are there executions of system info commands by suspicious users?"
      - "Are info-gathering commands run outside of normal admin activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command line auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Queries to Installed Software or Patch Levels"
    description: >
      Identify queries retrieving installed software lists or patch statuses (e.g., wmic product, registry queries).
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected accesses to software inventory or registry keys?"
      - "Is there correlation with reconnaissance or lateral movement?"
    data_sources:
      - "Registry access logs"
      - "Process and command logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Host Info Gathering with Other Recon or Attack Activities"
    description: >
      Check if information gathering precedes privilege escalation, lateral movement, or exploitation.
    checklist:
      - "Is there suspicious process or network activity following host info gathering?"
      - "Are there abnormal authentication events?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate system audits."
      - "Medium: Info gathering by non-admin users."
      - "High: Host info gathering linked to suspicious activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized system info commands."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unverified info queries."
      - "Low: Routine administrative activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of system info commands (systeminfo, uname, hostname)"
  - "WMI or registry queries for software/hardware info"
  - "Unexpected access to system configuration files"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect System Information Commands"
    query: >
      process.name IN ("cmd.exe", "powershell.exe", "wmic.exe") AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)(systeminfo|hostname|uname|Get-WmiObject)"

  - name: "Detect Registry Queries for Software Info"
    query: >
      registry.key_path CONTAINS "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized system information commands."
  - "Restrict access to system info and software inventory."
  - "Monitor subsequent suspicious activities."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if info gathering is legitimate."
  - "Investigate following suspicious activity."
  - "Recommend tightening access to host info queries."
