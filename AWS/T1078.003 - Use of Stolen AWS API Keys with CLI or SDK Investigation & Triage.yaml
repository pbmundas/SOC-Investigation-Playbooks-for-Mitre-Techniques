playbook_name: "T1078.003 - Use of Stolen AWS API Keys with CLI or SDK: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1078.003"
technique_name: "Use of Stolen AWS API Keys with CLI or SDK"
description: >
  Detect unauthorized use of stolen AWS API keys through AWS CLI or SDK to access or manipulate AWS resources.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect API Calls Using Unrecognized or Suspicious Access Keys"
    description: >
      Monitor AWS CloudTrail logs for API calls originating from unknown or suspicious access key IDs.
    checklist:
      - "Are there API calls using AccessKeyIds not linked to known users or applications?"
      - "Are there calls from unusual geographic locations or IP addresses?"
      - "Are there spikes in API usage or abnormal timing?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail"
      - "IAM Access Logs"
      - "Network logs and geolocation data"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Command-Line or SDK Usage Patterns"
    description: >
      Examine command-line arguments and SDK usage metadata to detect malicious activities.
    checklist:
      - "Are there commands for resource creation, deletion, or privilege escalation?"
      - "Is the API usage pattern different from legitimate automation?"
      - "Are there repetitive or scripted API calls?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail API request parameters"
      - "Command-line monitoring (if available)"
      - "SDK call metadata"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Anomalies or Indicators of Compromise"
    description: >
      Cross-reference with IAM changes, network traffic anomalies, or alerts from threat intelligence.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new IAM roles or users created soon after?"
      - "Is there evidence of lateral movement or data exfiltration?"
      - "Are monitoring or logging mechanisms being disabled?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "Network monitoring"
      - "SIEM correlation"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known automation using keys."
      - "Medium: Unusual API key usage."
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized use of stolen keys."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Access keys linked to breach or malicious IPs."
      - "Medium: Anomalous usage patterns."
      - "Low: Potential false positives from new automation."

ioc_types:
  - "API calls with unknown AccessKeyId"
  - "Access from untrusted IPs or geolocations"
  - "Abnormal CLI/SDK usage patterns"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect API calls with unknown AccessKeyId"
    query: >
      NOT userIdentity.accessKeyId IN (trusted_keys)
  - name: "Detect API calls from unusual IPs"
    query: >
      sourceIPAddress NOT IN (trusted_IPs)

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious API key usage."
  - "Revoke or rotate compromised API keys."
  - "Trigger incident response and forensic analysis."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if API keys belong to legitimate applications."
  - "Investigate command patterns and network locations."
  - "Contain and remediate compromised credentials immediately."
