playbook_name: "T1552.005 - Abuse AWS EC2 Metadata Service to Steal Credentials"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1552.005"
technique_name: "Unsecured Credentials: Cloud Instance Metadata API"
description: >
  Detect access to the EC2 instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254) in attempts to retrieve temporary
  credentials, often as part of lateral movement or initial access by an attacker.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Metadata Access"
    description: >
      Detect access to the metadata service by unauthorized or external processes.
    checklist:
      - "Are there HTTP GET requests to 169.254.169.254 from within the instance?"
      - "Is the accessing process unfamiliar or launched via injected code?"
    data_sources:
      - "VPC Flow Logs"
      - "CloudTrail (for instance profile activity)"
      - "Instance audit logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate Usage with IAM Activity"
    description: >
      Confirm whether the retrieved credentials were used to perform API calls or privilege escalation.
    checklist:
      - "Was there a spike in API usage from the instance?"
      - "Are temporary credentials used outside expected scope/IP?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "GuardDuty"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Scripted system process or expected service probe."
      - "Medium: Unexpected metadata access from user shell."
      - "High: Verified credential theft and use."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Metadata call followed by credential use."
      - "Medium: Metadata probe without follow-up."
      - "Low: Scheduled probe."

ioc_types:
  - "HTTP requests to 169.254.169.254"
  - "Temporary credential use from unknown IPs"
  - "Unexpected role assumption"
