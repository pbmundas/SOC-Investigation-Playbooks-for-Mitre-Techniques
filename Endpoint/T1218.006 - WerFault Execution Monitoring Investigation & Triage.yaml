technique_id: "T1218.006"
technique_name: "WerFault Execution Monitoring"
description: >
  Detect abuse of WerFault.exe (Windows Error Reporting) for execution of malicious payloads or defense evasion.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect WerFault Execution"
    description: >
      Monitor process creation for WerFault.exe, especially with suspicious command lines or parent processes.
    checklist:
      - "Is WerFault.exe running unusually outside error reporting?"
      - "Are there suspicious parameters or scripts launched?"
      - "Is WerFault.exe started by unauthorized users or processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation and command line logs"
      - "Endpoint telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Command Line and Execution Context"
    description: >
      Examine if WerFault.exe is used to launch non-standard applications or payloads.
    checklist:
      - "Are command line arguments abnormal or pointing to malware?"
      - "Is WerFault.exe spawning suspicious child processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "File and network monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Malicious Activities"
    description: >
      Identify related malicious behavior such as persistence, lateral movement, or credential dumping.
    checklist:
      - "Are there related suspicious processes or network connections?"
      - "Is there evidence of compromised accounts?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM"
      - "Threat intel"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Response and Containment"
    description: >
      Block or restrict WerFault.exe usage if unauthorized and isolate infected hosts.
    checklist:
      - "Implement application controls."
      - "Engage IR for deeper investigation."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint security tools"
      - "Incident response"

  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious execution."
      - "Medium: Suspicious indicators."
      - "Low: Benign use."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious WerFault.exe command lines"
  - "Unusual parent-child processes"
  - "Known malicious indicators"
