tactic: "Execution"
technique_id: "T1608.001"
technique_name: "Local Job Scheduling"
description: >
  Detect and investigate the creation and abuse of AWS Lambda triggers or EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events)
  scheduled rules that automate execution of tasks, potentially for malicious persistence, automation of attacks,
  or data collection.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Creation of Lambda Triggers and EventBridge Rules"
    description: >
      Identify creation or modification of Lambda function triggers and EventBridge scheduled rules that
      may indicate attacker persistence or automation.
    checklist:
      - "Are new EventBridge rules or Lambda triggers created outside of maintenance windows?"
      - "Do schedules trigger suspicious Lambda functions or workflows?"
      - "Are trigger creators or modifiers authorized and following policy?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "AWS Config"
      - "CloudWatch Events Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Review Execution Patterns of Scheduled Lambda Functions"
    description: >
      Analyze Lambda invocations linked to scheduled events to detect unusual timing or frequency indicative of malicious activity.
    checklist:
      - "Is there an unusual increase in Lambda execution frequency?"
      - "Do scheduled events invoke functions accessing sensitive resources?"
      - "Are any functions triggered that are not part of documented business processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudWatch Logs"
      - "Lambda Execution Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Validate Permissions and Rule Configurations"
    description: >
      Ensure that IAM roles and permissions attached to EventBridge rules and Lambda functions follow least privilege principles and that rule configurations have not been tampered with.
    checklist:
      - "Are EventBridge rules configured with proper authorization?"
      - "Do Lambda execution roles have excessive permissions?"
      - "Have rule targets or inputs been modified unexpectedly?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS Config"
      - "IAM Access Analyzer"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Scheduled jobs created by authorized users for business operations."
      - "Medium: Unusual or undocumented scheduled jobs detected."
      - "High: Malicious or unauthorized scheduled jobs detected."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear evidence of unauthorized scheduling and malicious intent."
      - "Medium: Suspicious scheduling with incomplete confirmation."
      - "Low: Legitimate scheduled tasks with minor anomalies."

ioc_types:
  - "Creation/modification of EventBridge scheduled rules"
  - "Lambda triggers linked to suspicious events"
  - "Unusual execution patterns of scheduled Lambda functions"

    query: >

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on creation or modification of EventBridge rules by non-admin users."
  - "Trigger immediate review of newly scheduled Lambda triggers."
  - "Block or quarantine suspicious scheduled executions pending investigation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify business justification and authorization for all scheduled jobs."
  - "Correlate scheduled Lambda activity with other suspicious behaviors."
  - "Recommend tightening IAM policies to limit scheduling permissions."
