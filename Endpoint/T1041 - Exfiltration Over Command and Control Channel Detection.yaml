playbook_name: "T1041 - Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel Detection"
tactic: "Exfiltration"
technique_id: "T1041"
technique_name: "Exfiltration Over C2 Channel"
description: >
  Detect adversaries exfiltrating data by using their command and control channels.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Data Transfers on Known C2 Channels"
    description: >
      Identify large or unusual outbound data transfers over established C2 communications.
    checklist:
      - "Are there spikes in outbound data volume on known C2 sessions?"
      - "Is data being sent at unusual times or frequencies?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network flow logs"
      - "EDR network telemetry"
      - "C2 detection alerts"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Payload Characteristics"
    description: >
      Inspect payload for encoded, compressed, or encrypted exfiltrated data.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of data encoding or encryption within C2 traffic?"
      - "Are payload sizes larger than typical command messages?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network packet captures"
      - "Network analysis tools"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Endpoint Activity"
    description: >
      Investigate endpoint processes that establish C2 channels.
    checklist:
      - "Which processes are communicating over C2?"
      - "Are there file creation or read events correlated with C2 data transfer?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "Process monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal C2 communications."
      - "Medium: Suspicious data volumes."
      - "High: Confirmed data exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed exfiltration via C2."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Unusual data volume on C2"
  - "Encoded/encrypted payloads"
  - "Suspicious process activity"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Large Outbound Data on C2 Ports"
    query: >
      network.outbound_bytes > threshold AND
      network.destination_port IN c2_ports

  - name: "Detect Suspicious Process Communications Over C2"
    query: >
      endpoint.process IN suspicious_processes AND
      network.connection_to_c2 = true

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious exfiltration over C2."
  - "Isolate affected endpoints."
  - "Trigger incident response."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate exfiltration and data volume."
  - "Identify data types and scope."
  - "Coordinate with network and IR teams."
