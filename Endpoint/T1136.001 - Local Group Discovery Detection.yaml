tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1136.001"
technique_name: "Local Group Discovery"
description: >
  Detect reconnaissance activity where attackers enumerate local groups on hosts to gain insight
  into system permissions and potential escalation paths.

detection_sources:
  - Windows Security Event Logs (EventID 4731, 4735, 4737)
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  - PowerShell and command line logging
  - SIEM correlation on suspicious group enumeration commands

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Local Group Enumeration Events"
    description: >
      Identify event logs or commands showing local group enumeration.
    checklist:
      - "Monitor EventIDs related to local group changes or queries"
      - "Detect PowerShell commands like Get-LocalGroup or net localgroup"
      - "Review frequency and source of these queries"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows event logs"
      - "PowerShell logging"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate with User and Endpoint Behavior"
    description: >
      Investigate the user accounts and endpoints involved.
    checklist:
      - "Check if account is administrative or suspicious"
      - "Review recent logins and access patterns"
      - "Analyze endpoint for other suspicious activity"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR logs"
      - "UEBA systems"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Containment and Response"
    description: >
      Take steps to limit reconnaissance and potential escalation.
    checklist:
      - "Restrict suspicious accounts"
      - "Increase endpoint monitoring"
      - "Apply appropriate privilege changes"
    data_sources:
      - "Identity and endpoint management systems"

triage_labels:
  - severity:
      - "Low: Single local group query"
      - "Medium: Multiple queries or unusual patterns"
      - "High: Suspected lateral movement preparation"
  - confidence:
      - "High: Confirmed suspicious commands or events"
      - "Medium: Anomalous but unconfirmed"
      - "Low: Normal admin behavior"
