playbook_name: "T1070 - Host Artifact Removal Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1070"
technique_name: "Indicator Removal on Host"
description: >
  Detect attempts to remove host-based forensic artifacts such as log files, event logs, or temporary files to cover tracks.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Deletion or Modification of Logs"
    description: >
      Detect deletions or tampering of event logs, security logs, and audit trails.
    checklist:
      - "Are log files deleted or cleared unexpectedly?"
      - "Are audit policies changed or disabled?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Windows Event Logs"
      - "Audit logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Clearing or Erasing Commands"
    description: >
      Identify usage of tools or commands such as 'wevtutil', 'Clear-EventLog', or log wiping scripts.
    checklist:
      - "Are clearing commands executed by unusual users or processes?"
      - "Is there a pattern of repeated log clearance?"
    data_sources:
      - "Command line monitoring"
      - "Process logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious Activity"
    description: >
      Investigate if artifact removal correlates with suspicious access, privilege escalation, or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Is log removal timed with other malicious actions?"
      - "Are other defense evasion techniques observed?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM correlation"
      - "Endpoint telemetry"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Recover and Respond"
    description: >
      Attempt log recovery and initiate incident response.
    checklist:
      - "Restore logs from backups if possible."
      - "Contain and remediate affected hosts."
    data_sources:
      - "Backup systems"
      - "IR tools"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate log maintenance or archiving."
      - "Medium: Unexpected log clearance needing review."
      - "High: Confirmed log tampering linked to attack."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known artifact removal behavior."
      - "Medium: Suspicious log operations."
      - "Low: Routine maintenance."

ioc_types:
  - "Log file deletions"
  - "Clear-eventlog commands"
  - "Audit policy changes"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Windows Clear Event Log Commands"
    query: >
      process.command_line:*Clear-EventLog* OR process.command_line:*wevtutil*"
  - name: "Linux Log File Deletions"
    query: >
      process.name:rm AND file.path:/var/log/*

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on event log clearing commands."
  - "Flag hosts with repeated log file deletions."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review user/process context for log removal."
  - "Check for other attack indicators."
  - "Coordinate with IR for potential compromise."
