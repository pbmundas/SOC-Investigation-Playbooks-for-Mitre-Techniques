playbook_name: "T1033 - Policy Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1033"
technique_name: "System Owner/User Discovery (Policy Discovery)"
description: >
  Detects adversaries gathering information about system or domain policies including user privileges, group policies, or system configurations to understand security posture or plan privilege escalation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Commands and Queries Retrieving Policy Information"
    description: >
      Identify execution of commands or tools querying Group Policy Objects (GPOs), user rights assignments, or security policies.
    checklist:
      - "Are there LDAP or PowerShell queries targeting policy objects?"
      - "Are queries performed by unusual or unauthorized users?"
    data_sources:
      - "PowerShell logs"
      - "LDAP query logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Access to Local or Domain Policy Files"
    description: >
      Monitor file or registry access related to policy configuration files.
    checklist:
      - "Are policy files or registry keys accessed unexpectedly?"
      - "Is the access correlated with suspicious process activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Registry audit logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Policy Discovery with Other Recon Activities"
    description: >
      Determine if policy discovery is linked with privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there subsequent attempts to modify privileges?"
      - "Is there suspicious authentication or process creation after discovery?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Process creation logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate policy audits."
      - "Medium: Policy discovery by non-admin users."
      - "High: Discovery linked to suspicious privilege escalation."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized policy queries."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unverified policy access."
      - "Low: Normal administrative activity."

ioc_types:
  - "LDAP queries to Group Policy or user rights"
  - "PowerShell commands querying policies"
  - "Access to local or domain policy files"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect PowerShell GPO Queries"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-GPO|Get-ADObject -Filter 'ObjectClass -eq \"groupPolicyContainer\"'"

  - name: "Detect Access to Local Security Policy Files"
    query: >
      file.path ENDSWITH "secpol.msc" OR
      registry.key_path CONTAINS "SOFTWARE\\Policies"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious policy discovery commands."
  - "Restrict access to policy files and LDAP queries."
  - "Review user permissions and audit logs."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if policy discovery is legitimate."
  - "Check for signs of privilege escalation."
  - "Recommend hardening access controls for policy objects."
