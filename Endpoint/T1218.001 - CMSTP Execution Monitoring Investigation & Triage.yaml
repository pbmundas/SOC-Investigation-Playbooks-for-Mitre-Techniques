description: >
  Detect abuse of the CMSTP (Connection Manager Profile Installer) signed binary to execute malicious code.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect CMSTP Execution"
    description: >
      Monitor process creation events for cmstp.exe executions, especially with unusual command line arguments.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected or suspicious parameters passed to cmstp.exe?"
      - "Is cmstp.exe invoked by unusual users or processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command line logging"
      - "Endpoint telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Command Line Arguments"
    description: >
      Investigate arguments for execution of scripts, remote payloads, or non-standard CM profiles.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of remote file execution via cmstp?"
      - "Are local scripts or files executed unexpectedly?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process command line details"
      - "File system monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Related Suspicious Activity"
    description: >
      Check if CMSTP execution coincides with lateral movement, privilege escalation, or malware deployment.
    checklist:
      - "Are other suspicious processes active?"
      - "Are user accounts or systems compromised?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM correlation"
      - "Endpoint alerts"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Contain"
    description: >
      Block or isolate affected hosts, disable CMSTP execution if unauthorized.
    checklist:
      - "Restrict cmstp.exe execution via application control policies."
      - "Engage incident response team."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "Incident response tools"
