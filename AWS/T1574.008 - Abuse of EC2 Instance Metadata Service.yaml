playbook_name: "T1574.008 - Abuse of EC2 Instance Metadata Service"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1574.008"
technique_name: "Cloud Instance Metadata"
description: >
  Detect and investigate abuse of the AWS EC2 instance metadata service (IMDS) to
  obtain temporary credentials or sensitive information, which can be used for privilege escalation,
  lateral movement, or persistent access.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to EC2 Instance Metadata Endpoint"
    description: >
      Track all access to the IMDS endpoint (`http://169.254.169.254`) from EC2 instances,
      looking for unusual or unauthorized requests, including from unexpected sources or by unexpected users.
    checklist:
      - "Are there requests to the metadata endpoint from unexpected or unauthorized sources?"
      - "Is there excessive or unusual frequency of metadata queries?"
      - "Are metadata requests accessing sensitive token or IAM role information?"
    data_sources:
      - "VPC Flow Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "Instance Metadata Access Logs (if enabled)"
      - "Network Traffic Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Attempts to Harvest Temporary Credentials"
    description: >
      Look for suspicious activities that indicate extraction of temporary IAM credentials via the metadata service,
      such as retrieval of security tokens or role credentials.
    checklist:
      - "Are IAM security tokens or temporary credentials being requested?"
      - "Are extracted credentials used immediately in suspicious API calls?"
      - "Is there evidence of scripts or tools querying IMDS for credentials?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "AWS API Call Logs"
      - "Network Traffic Analysis"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Investigate Unusual Use of Retrieved Credentials"
    description: >
      Track the use of credentials obtained via IMDS for unauthorized actions or privilege escalation.
    checklist:
      - "Are credentials from IMDS used to access unauthorized AWS resources?"
      - "Is there a pattern of privilege escalation or lateral movement following credential use?"
      - "Are there API calls made by unusual or unexpected IAM roles or users?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "IAM Access Logs"
      - "AWS Config"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Metadata accessed by authorized system processes."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or anomalous access to metadata service."
      - "High: Confirmed abuse of metadata service to extract credentials."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear evidence of unauthorized credential extraction."
      - "Medium: Suspicious activity without full confirmation."
      - "Low: Routine metadata access consistent with normal operations."

ioc_types:
  - "HTTP requests to 169.254.169.254 for security tokens or IAM role info"
  - "Unusual API calls immediately following metadata credential retrieval"
  - "Scripts or automation tools accessing instance metadata service"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Metadata Service Access Detection"
    query: >
      vpcflowlogs: dstAddr=169.254.169.254 AND action=ACCEPT
  - name: "CloudTrail API Calls After Metadata Access"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventName IN (AssumeRole, GetCallerIdentity) AND sourceIPAddress IN (list of EC2 IPs)
  - name: "Unusual Credential Usage"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventSource="sts.amazonaws.com" AND userAgent NOT IN known_services

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on excessive or anomalous metadata service access."
  - "Trigger IAM credential usage review following metadata access."
  - "Block suspicious API calls using credentials derived from IMDS."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate the legitimacy of metadata access based on instance role and workload."
  - "Correlate metadata access with downstream AWS API calls."
  - "Recommend disabling or restricting IMDS access where possible (IMDSv2)."
