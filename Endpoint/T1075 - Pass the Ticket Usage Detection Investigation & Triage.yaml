playbook_name: "T1075 - Pass the Ticket Usage Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1075"
technique_name: "Pass the Ticket"
description: >
  Detects adversaries using stolen Kerberos tickets (TGTs or service tickets) to authenticate as other users without needing their credentials.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Kerberos Ticket Usage"
    description: >
      Track Kerberos ticket requests, renewals, and usage patterns to identify anomalous behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual service ticket requests from endpoints?"
      - "Are ticket requests originating from uncommon hosts or accounts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Kerberos authentication logs"
      - "Windows Security Event Logs (Event ID 4769, 4771, 4768)"
  
  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Reuse of Tickets Across Multiple Hosts"
    description: >
      Detect Kerberos tickets used on different machines than where originally issued.
    checklist:
      - "Are tickets presented from endpoints that are unusual for the user?"
      - "Is there evidence of ticket reuse in short timeframes across locations?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network authentication logs"
      - "Endpoint logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Ticket Usage with Suspicious Activities"
    description: >
      Review activities performed post-ticket use for lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual processes or network connections following ticket authentication?"
      - "Is there privilege escalation or administrative commands executed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate ticket usage within normal patterns."
      - "Medium: Suspicious ticket use with incomplete context."
      - "High: Confirmed misuse or lateral movement using tickets."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed ticket misuse with correlated malicious activity."
      - "Medium: Anomalous ticket usage without full evidence."
      - "Low: Ticket use matching known legitimate activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Kerberos ticket reuse across multiple hosts"
  - "Unusual service ticket requests"
  - "Anomalous Kerberos event IDs (4768, 4769, 4771)"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Kerberos Ticket Requests"
    query: >
      event_id IN (4768, 4769) AND
      kerberos.service_name NOT IN ("krbtgt", "host") AND
      source_ip NOT IN userâ€™s usual IPs

  - name: "Detect Ticket Reuse on Different Hosts"
    query: >
      kerberos.ticket_id IS NOT NULL AND
      destination_ip NOT IN known host list for user

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on anomalous Kerberos ticket usage."
  - "Force re-authentication or ticket invalidation."
  - "Isolate endpoint if lateral movement suspected."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify the legitimacy of Kerberos ticket use."
  - "Check for lateral movement or privilege escalation signs."
  - "Recommend resetting compromised accounts if confirmed."
