technique_name: "Network Denial of Service"
description: >
  Legacy detection playbook for DoS attacks at the network level. Use updated T1609/T1610 where applicable.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Common DoS Patterns"
    description: >
      Look for ICMP floods, SYN floods, or application-level abuses.
    checklist:
      - "Are there multiple connection attempts with no completions?"
      - "Are ICMP echo requests spiking?"
    data_sources:
      - "Firewall logs"
      - "NetFlow/packet capture"
      - "IDS alerts"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Affected Targets"
    description: >
      Check whether servers or endpoints are overloaded or offline.
    checklist:
      - "Are endpoints unreachable?"
      - "Are there abnormal CPU/memory spikes?"
    data_sources:
      - "System monitoring tools"
      - "Ping and connectivity tests"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Small-scale, no impact."
      - "High: Multiple services disrupted."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Validated attack patterns."
      - "Medium: Traffic anomaly."

ioc_types:
  - "DoS traffic indicators"
  - "Repeated source IPs"
  - "Resource exhaustion logs"
