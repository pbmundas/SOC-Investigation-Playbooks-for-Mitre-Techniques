playbook_name: "T1087.002 - Domain Account Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1087.002"
technique_name: "Domain Account Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries enumerating domain accounts through directory services queries or domain reconnaissance to plan further attacks.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor LDAP and Directory Service Queries"
    description: >
      Detect queries against Active Directory for user and group enumeration using LDAP, PowerShell, or domain tools.
    checklist:
      - "Are there LDAP queries for user or group listings?"
      - "Is PowerShell used with modules like ActiveDirectory for enumeration?"
    data_sources:
      - "Directory service logs"
      - "PowerShell logging"
      - "Network traffic logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Suspicious Domain Enumeration Behavior"
    description: >
      Look for enumeration activity outside normal operational patterns or from unauthorized users.
    checklist:
      - "Is enumeration originating from unusual hosts or accounts?"
      - "Are there large-scale queries or repeated enumeration attempts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Reconnaissance or Privilege Escalation Attempts"
    description: >
      Investigate if domain enumeration correlates with privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Is there subsequent access to sensitive resources?"
      - "Are other reconnaissance or exploitation activities observed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint and network logs"
      - "Security event logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Domain enumeration by authorized IT personnel."
      - "Medium: Enumeration by unusual accounts or devices."
      - "High: Enumeration linked to confirmed intrusion."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified unauthorized domain account enumeration."
      - "Medium: Suspicious activity pending confirmation."
      - "Low: Normal administrative scans."

ioc_types:
  - "LDAP queries for user and group objects"
  - "PowerShell ActiveDirectory module commands"
  - "DSQuery or net commands targeting domain accounts"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect LDAP Enumeration Queries"
    query: >
      event.type == "ldap_query" AND
      query.objectClass IN ("user", "group")

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Active Directory Enumeration"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-ADUser|Get-ADGroup"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious domain enumeration activity."
  - "Restrict directory query permissions."
  - "Initiate incident response if linked to intrusions."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify intent and legitimacy of directory queries."
  - "Investigate related network and endpoint activity."
  - "Recommend enhanced monitoring and access controls."
