playbook_name: "T1537 - Transfer Data to Attacker-Controlled AWS Accounts"
tactic: "Exfiltration"
technique_id: "T1537"
technique_name: "Transfer Data to Cloud Account"
description: >
  Detect and investigate attempts where attackers copy or transfer data from the victim AWS environment
  to attacker-controlled AWS accounts, often using cross-account permissions or compromised credentials.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Cross-Account Data Transfers"
    description: >
      Review CloudTrail logs for cross-account S3 replication, bucket policies, or IAM role assumptions
      enabling data transfer to external AWS accounts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there newly created or modified bucket policies allowing external account access?"
      - "Are there IAM role assumptions from unknown or untrusted accounts?"
      - "Is there evidence of cross-account S3 replication configured?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "S3 Bucket Policies"
      - "IAM Role Assumption Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Large or Unusual Data Copy Operations"
    description: >
      Identify large S3 data copy or replication jobs to external accounts, unusual AWS CLI commands,
      or SDK usage targeting external buckets.
    checklist:
      - "Are there large or bulk S3 copy operations to buckets owned by other accounts?"
      - "Are AWS CLI or SDK commands issuing cross-account copy or upload operations?"
      - "Are data transfer patterns outside normal operational hours?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "S3 Access Logs"
      - "AWS CLI Command Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Data Transfer with Identity and Access Changes"
    description: >
      Review whether the data transfer is preceded by privilege escalation, new key creation,
      or suspicious access to IAM policies.
    checklist:
      - "Are there recent IAM changes or key creations linked to the transfer?"
      - "Is the transfer initiated by service accounts or unusual user identities?"
      - "Is there correlation with other suspicious activities like persistence or reconnaissance?"
    data_sources:
      - "IAM Access Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "Security Config Change Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized cross-account replication with audit logs."
      - "Medium: Unusual cross-account access requiring validation."
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized data transfer to attacker accounts."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified transfer to known attacker account."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access with incomplete confirmation."
      - "Low: Routine replication with minor anomalies."

ioc_types:
  - "Cross-account S3 replication or copy events"
  - "IAM role assumption by unknown external accounts"
  - "New or modified bucket policies allowing external access"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Cross-Account Bucket Policy Changes"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventName="PutBucketPolicy" AND requestParameters.policyDocument.statement.resource LIKE "%arn:aws:s3:::external-bucket%"
  - name: "S3 Copy to External Account"
    query: >
      s3_access_logs: eventName IN ("CopyObject", "PutObject") AND destinationAccountId != sourceAccountId
  - name: "IAM Role Assumption from Unknown Account"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventName="AssumeRole" AND sourceIPAddress NOT IN trusted_ips

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on new or modified bucket policies granting cross-account access."
  - "Trigger IAM key rotation or suspension on suspicious role assumptions."
  - "Initiate network or API session blocks on suspected compromised accounts."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm business justification for cross-account data transfers."
  - "Review permissions and audit logs for unauthorized access."
  - "Recommend tightening cross-account trust policies and monitoring."
