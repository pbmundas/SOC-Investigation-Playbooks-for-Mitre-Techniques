tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1564.001"

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Hidden Attributes on Files and Directories"
    description: >
      Identify files or folders marked with hidden or system attributes that are unusual or located in suspicious directories.
    checklist:
      - "Are files or directories set with hidden or system attributes?"
      - "Are these artifacts in non-standard locations or user directories?"
      - "Are alternate data streams present on files?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"
      - "PowerShell or Sysinternals tools telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Verify File and Directory Integrity"
    description: >
      Check for unauthorized changes, creation, or access of hidden files.
    checklist:
      - "Have new hidden files or directories appeared unexpectedly?"
      - "Are there modifications to existing hidden files?"
    data_sources:
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "SIEM file change alerts"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Hidden Files with Malicious Behavior"
    description: >
      Associate hidden files with suspicious process execution, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Do hidden files correspond to known malware or scripts?"
      - "Are they linked to suspicious processes or network connections?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint telemetry"
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Network monitoring"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Remove Hidden Artifacts"
    description: >
      Quarantine or delete malicious hidden files and adjust monitoring.
    checklist:
      - "Remove unauthorized hidden files or directories."
      - "Adjust file system monitoring to detect future hiding attempts."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint remediation tools"
      - "IR ticketing system"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate system or application hidden files."
      - "Medium: Suspicious hidden files requiring further analysis."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious hidden files."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known malicious patterns."
      - "Medium: Anomalous but uncertain."
      - "Low: Known benign hidden artifacts."

ioc_types:
  - "Files/directories with hidden/system attributes"
  - "Files with alternate data streams"
  - "Unexpected hidden file creation/modification"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect hidden files or directories"
    query: >
      (file.attributes:hidden OR file.attributes:system) AND NOT file.path:known_system_files

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on new hidden files in user or temp directories."
  - "Trigger review on detection of alternate data streams."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if hidden files are part of legitimate OS or app behavior."
  - "Correlate with threat intel or malware hashes."
  - "Check file creation and modification timelines."
