investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Deletion Events in CloudTrail Logs"
    description: >
      Identify deletion or modification events involving EBS volumes, snapshots, or S3 buckets.
    checklist:
      - "Are there deleteVolume, deleteSnapshot, or deleteBucket events logged?"
      - "Are deletions occurring in bulk or during unusual hours?"
      - "Are deletions initiated by unexpected IAM users or roles?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "AWS Config"
      - "S3 Access Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Review Changes in AWS Config for Resource Compliance"
    description: >
      Detect configuration changes or compliance violations related to storage resources.
    checklist:
      - "Are resources removed violating compliance rules?"
      - "Are deletion or retention policies changed unexpectedly?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS Config"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Deletion Events with Malicious Activities"
    description: >
      Investigate whether deletion is linked to compromised credentials, privilege escalation, or ransomware behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Are IAM changes or privilege escalations preceding deletion?"
      - "Is there evidence of ransomware activity or extortion demands?"
      - "Are alerts triggered for unusual resource deletion?"
    data_sources:
      - "IAM Logs"
      - "EDR or Endpoint Security Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized deletions with change control."
      - "Medium: Unusual deletions requiring investigation."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious or unauthorized disk wipe."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious deletion or data wiping."
      - "Medium: Suspicious deletions with incomplete context."
      - "Low: Routine maintenance or clean-up."

ioc_types:
  - "DeleteVolume, DeleteSnapshot, DeleteBucket API calls"
  - "Bulk or unusual deletion patterns"
  - "Deletion events from untrusted users or IPs"
