playbook_name: "T1560.001 - Archive via Utility Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1560.001"
technique_name: "Archive via Utility"
description: >
  Detects adversaries using standard archiving utilities (e.g., zip, tar, rar) to compress collected data for exfiltration.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Execution of Archiving Utilities"
    description: >
      Identify execution of common archiving commands or binaries such as zip, tar, rar, 7zip.
    checklist:
      - "Are archiving utilities executed unexpectedly or by unusual users?"
      - "Is execution correlated with access to sensitive files?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line logging"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Creation of Archive Files by Utilities"
    description: >
      Detect creation of compressed archive files (.zip, .tar, .rar, etc.) linked to archiving utility execution.
    checklist:
      - "Are archive files created in non-standard or sensitive locations?"
      - "Is archive file creation followed by suspicious file movement or network transfer?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Process monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Archive Creation with Data Access and Exfiltration"
    description: >
      Investigate if archive creation coincides with data staging or transfer activities.
    checklist:
      - "Are archive files moved or uploaded externally shortly after creation?"
      - "Is the user or process behavior abnormal?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "User behavior analytics"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized archive utility use for backups or maintenance."
      - "Medium: Suspicious archive creation without evidence of exfiltration."
      - "High: Unauthorized archiving linked to data theft."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified archiving followed by suspicious data movement."
      - "Medium: Archive creation by unusual users or processes."
      - "Low: Normal archive utility use."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of zip, tar, rar, or 7zip utilities"
  - "Creation of archive files in sensitive locations"
  - "Archive files transferred externally"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Archive Utility Execution"
    query: >
      process.name IN ("zip", "tar", "rar", "7z") AND
      user.name NOT IN ("backup", "admin")

  - name: "Archive File Creation by Utilities"
    query: >
      file.extension IN (".zip", ".rar", ".tar", ".7z") AND
      process.parent.name IN ("zip", "tar", "rar", "7z")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on archive utility execution by unauthorized users."
  - "Block file movement of archive files if suspicious."
  - "Notify incident response team for review."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if archiving is authorized and legitimate."
  - "Review related file access and network activity."
  - "Check user and process context for anomalies."
