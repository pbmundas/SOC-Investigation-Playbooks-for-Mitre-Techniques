technique_name: "Windows Service Execution"
description: >
  Playbook to investigate suspicious or malicious creation, modification, or execution of Windows services,
  used by adversaries to achieve persistence or execute code on system startup.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify New or Modified Windows Services"
    description: >
      Detect creation or modification of Windows services in the system.
    checklist:
      - "Which services were created or modified recently?"
      - "What executable paths or binaries are associated with these services?"
      - "Are these services set to auto-start?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Event Logs (Service Control Manager)"
      - "Registry change logs (HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services)"
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "EDR process and service monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Service Binary and Parameters"
    description: >
      Review the service executable and its parameters for suspicious activity.
    checklist:
      - "Is the executable signed and from a trusted publisher?"
      - "Does it execute scripts, command lines, or payloads with suspicious behavior?"
      - "Are there known malicious hashes or behavior patterns?"
    data_sources:
      - "File metadata and signature info"
      - "Static/dynamic malware analysis"
      - "Threat intelligence"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Service Activity with Process and Network Logs"
    description: >
      Investigate any processes and network activity triggered by the service.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected or unauthorized process launches by the service?"
      - "Is there unusual outbound network traffic post service start?"
      - "Any privilege escalation or lateral movement detected?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs"
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "User session and privilege logs"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "User Context and Legitimacy Check"
    description: >
      Verify if the service modifications align with authorized admin actions.
    checklist:
      - "Which user created or modified the service?"
      - "Is this consistent with normal admin behavior?"
      - "Is the service part of known software or suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "User login and audit logs"
      - "Threat intelligence"
      - "SIEM correlation"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized service installation or update."
      - "Medium: Suspicious service changes with no malicious follow-up."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious or unauthorized service activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: IOC matches or known attack patterns."
      - "Medium: Suspicious activity needing further investigation."
      - "Low: Legitimate administrative actions."

ioc_types:
  - "Windows service names"
  - "Service executable paths"
  - "User accounts modifying services"
  - "Associated process hashes and command lines"
  - "Network connections post service start"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect New or Modified Windows Services"
    query: >
      event.id:7045 OR event.id:7040 AND
      event.timestamp:>=now-1d
  - name: "Services Executing Unsigned or Suspicious Binaries"
    query: >
      service.binary.signed:false OR
      service.binary.path:(*\\Temp\\* OR *\\AppData\\*)
  - name: "Process Creation by Windows Service"
    query: >
      process.parent.session_name:"Services" AND process.command_line:*

automation_hooks:
  - "Auto-hash and sandbox suspicious service executables"
  - "Alert on service creation/modification by non-admin users"
  - "Trigger endpoint isolation for confirmed malicious services"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review service creation/modification events closely."
  - "Analyze executable signatures and behavior."
  - "Correlate service activity with network and process logs."
  - "Leverage threat intel for known malware or attacker tools."
