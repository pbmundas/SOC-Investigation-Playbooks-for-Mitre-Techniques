description: >
  Investigation playbook to detect and triage abuse of macOS Launch Agents,
  often leveraged for persistence by placing malicious plist files in user space.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Launch Agent File Detection"
    description: >
      Identify creation or modification of Launch Agent plist files in user-accessible directories.
    checklist:
      - "Was a .plist file created in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/?"
      - "Does the label or file name look suspicious or random?"
      - "Is the file owned by a non-system user?"
    data_sources:
      - "File Creation Logs"
      - "macOS Unified Logs"
      - "EDR or FIM (File Integrity Monitoring)"
      - "SIEM Alerts"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Plist Content Inspection"
    description: >
      Examine contents of the Launch Agent plist for suspicious configurations.
    checklist:
      - "What binary or script does it execute (Program/ProgramArguments)?"
      - "Does it auto-start on login (RunAtLoad=true)?"
      - "Are there indicators of malicious intent (e.g., base64, curl, python)?"
    data_sources:
      - "Parsed Plist Files"
      - "Manual Inspection or Scripted Analysis"
      - "PlistBuddy Output"
      - "Process Execution Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Linked Binary Behavior"
    description: >
      Trace the binary or script configured in the Launch Agent for suspicious behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Is the binary unsigned or located in user-writable directories?"
      - "Does it spawn network activity or child shells?"
      - "Does it match any known threat actor TTPs?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR Process Tree"
      - "Network Connection Logs"
      - "Threat Intelligence Correlation"
      - "Binary Metadata"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "User and Scope Review"
    description: >
      Assess which users are affected and whether this is a targeted or widespread persistence method.
    checklist:
      - "Which user accounts have the suspicious Launch Agent installed?"
      - "Are other devices showing similar patterns?"
      - "Was the file delivered via phishing or dropper?"
    data_sources:
      - "User Login Records"
      - "Endpoint Inventory"
      - "Campaign/Threat Actor Analysis"
      - "Email Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate developer or tool-specific Launch Agent."
      - "Medium: Unsigned or unknown binary with no observable behavior yet."
      - "High: Malicious payload or known threat binary configured to run persistently."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Executable matches malware hash or known TTP."
      - "Medium: Suspicious location and user context but no execution yet."
      - "Low: Rare agent but used by legitimate applications."

ioc_types:
  - "Plist file path and name"
  - "Program/ProgramArguments command"
  - "Linked binary path and hash"
  - "User account"
  - "Outbound domains or IPs"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Suspicious Launch Agent File"
    query: >
      file.path:/Users/*/Library/LaunchAgents/*.plist AND NOT file.signature.trusted:true
  - name: "Launch Agent with Shell Execution"
    query: >
      plist.ProgramArguments:(*bash* OR *sh* OR *python* OR *curl* OR *osascript*)
  - name: "Launch Agent Executing from User Directory"
    query: >
      process.executable:/Users/*/Downloads/* AND initiated_by:launchd

automation_hooks:
  - "Auto-enrich plist Program path with VT/hash lookup"
  - "Trigger binary sandbox detonation for unknown launch agent executables"
  - "Isolate host if known malware Launch Agent is confirmed"
  - "Alert other endpoints with matching plist or binary hash"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Treat Launch Agents created outside of standard apps or tools as high risk."
  - "Correlate with phishing, suspicious user activity, or malware delivery attempts."
  - "Use ‘launchctl list’ and file system scanning to discover hidden or obfuscated agents."
  - "Always analyze the linked executable behavior before dismissing."
