playbook_name: "T1027.002 - Software Packing Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1027.002"
technique_name: "Software Packing"
description: >
  Detect use of packers or compression tools to obfuscate executable code.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Packed or Compressed Executables"
    description: >
      Identify executables with signatures or headers indicating packing.
    checklist:
      - "Is the binary packed with common packers (UPX, Themida, etc.)?"
      - "Are executable sections unusually compressed or encrypted?"
    data_sources:
      - "Static file analysis"
      - "File metadata and headers"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Runtime Behavior of Packed Executables"
    description: >
      Monitor execution patterns typical for unpacking behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Does the binary unpack code into memory dynamically?"
      - "Are API calls consistent with unpacking or decryption?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "API call logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Threat Intelligence"
    description: >
      Check if the packing method aligns with known malware families.
    checklist:
      - "Is the packer linked to known threats?"
      - "Are network connections consistent with known malware?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intel feeds"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate software using packers."
      - "Medium: Suspicious packed executables."
      - "High: Packed executables linked to malware."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known malicious packer detected."
      - "Medium: Unknown packer, suspicious context."
      - "Low: Common legitimate packer usage."

ioc_types:
  - "Packed executable signatures"
  - "Unusual executable header data"
  - "API calls typical of unpacking"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect UPX Packed Executables"
    query: >
      file.content:"UPX!" AND file.extension:"exe"
  - name: "Executables with Suspicious Packing"
    query: >
      file.metadata.packed:true

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on execution of unknown packed binaries."
  - "Trigger sandbox execution for behavior analysis."
  - "Block binaries packed with known malicious packers."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if packing is normal for the software."
  - "Analyze unpacked behavior in sandbox or live environment."
  - "Cross-check with threat intelligence on packers."
