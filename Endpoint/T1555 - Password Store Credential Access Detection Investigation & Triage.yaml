tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1555"
technique_name: "Credentials from Password Stores"
description: >
  Detect attempts to access or dump credentials stored in password managers, browsers, or other credential stores.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Access to Password Store Files or Processes"
    description: >
      Monitor access to credential vaults, password manager files, browser password databases, or related processes.
    checklist:
      - "Are there suspicious file reads of browser vaults (e.g., Chrome's Login Data)?"
      - "Is there process execution that can extract stored credentials?"
      - "Are suspicious tools or scripts accessing password store APIs or files?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access logs"
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Command-line logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Known Tools or Malware Targeting Password Stores"
    description: >
      Detect execution of tools designed to extract credentials from password managers or browsers.
    checklist:
      - "Are tools like Mimikatz, LaZagne, or custom scripts detected?"
      - "Are suspicious PowerShell or script activities targeting credential stores?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious Behavior Post Access"
    description: >
      Look for lateral movement, data exfiltration, or account misuse after password store access.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual network authentications or data flows?"
      - "Is there evidence of account takeover or privilege escalation?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network traffic logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate user activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious password store access without known tool."
      - "High: Confirmed credential extraction from password stores."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known tool or malware execution."
      - "Medium: Abnormal file or process access."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to browser password databases"
  - "Execution of credential dumping tools targeting password stores"
  - "Suspicious script or process access"
