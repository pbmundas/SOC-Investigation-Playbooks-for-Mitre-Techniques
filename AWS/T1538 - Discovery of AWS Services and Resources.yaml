playbook_name: "T1538 - Discovery of AWS Services and Resources"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1538"
technique_name: "Cloud Service Discovery"
description: >
  Detect enumeration of available AWS services and regional resource presence using APIs like
  DescribeInstances, DescribeBuckets, or ListFunctions. Adversaries may use these to plan lateral movement,
  privilege escalation, or data exfiltration paths.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Broad Enumeration Patterns"
    description: >
      Detect high-volume usage of Describe/List API calls targeting various AWS services.
    checklist:
      - "Check for enumeration across multiple regions in short succession."
      - "Correlate principal identity and IP to known automation or unusual activity."
      - "Review historical usage pattern of the access key or role."
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "GuardDuty (API Anomaly, Credential Discovery)"
      - "AWS Config"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Determine Intent and Follow-on Actions"
    description: >
      Investigate if the enumeration preceded privilege escalation or data exfiltration attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Were any new roles assumed or policies attached?"
      - "Was a data store or Lambda modified or accessed?"
      - "Was access done from an unfamiliar network location?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "IAM Access Analyzer"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate inventory audit or automation."
      - "Medium: Unusual enumeration across services."
      - "High: Enumeration followed by credential or data access."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Enumeration from unknown device/IP."
      - "Medium: Unusual sequence of API calls."
      - "Low: Background AWS inventory tools."

ioc_types:
  - "Describe*, List* API patterns across services"
  - "Cross-region enumeration"
  - "Multiple AWS service queries in <5 minutes"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Service Enumeration Detection"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventName STARTS WITH ("Describe", "List") AND userAgent != "AWSConsole"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert when unknown identity queries 5+ services in <5min."
  - "Trigger anomaly review on multi-region DescribeX calls"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Compare activity against baseline of known service usage."
  - "Review whether role or user is new or modified recently."
  - "Investigate correlating alerts indicating follow-on access."
