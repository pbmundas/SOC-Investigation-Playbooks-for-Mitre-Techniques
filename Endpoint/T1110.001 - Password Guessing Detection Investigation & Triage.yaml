playbook_name: "T1110.001 - Password Guessing Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1110.001"
technique_name: "Password Guessing"
description: >
  Detects attempts to guess account passwords, usually via single or few login attempts spread over many accounts or IPs.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Multiple Failed Logins Across Accounts"
    description: >
      Identify failed login attempts distributed across many accounts, indicating password guessing.
    checklist:
      - "Are failed attempts targeting many user accounts from a single IP?"
      - "Is the attempt rate high but per-account attempts low?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "SIEM correlation rules"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Source IP Reputation"
    description: >
      Check if source IPs have a history of malicious activity or belong to known threat actor infrastructure.
    checklist:
      - "Is the IP listed in threat intelligence feeds?"
      - "Is the IP associated with TOR, VPN, or proxies?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"
      - "Firewall logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Look for Subsequent Account Access"
    description: >
      Check if any accounts targeted have successful logins following guessing attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Any successful logins after failed guesses?"
      - "Is there suspicious activity from those accounts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "User activity monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Low volume of failed guesses, no success."
      - "Medium: Numerous guesses across accounts."
      - "High: Successful login after guessing attempts."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: IP flagged for password guessing and successful access."
      - "Medium: Pattern consistent with password guessing."
      - "Low: Sporadic failed logins."

ioc_types:
  - "Failed login attempts spread over many accounts"
  - "Use of suspicious or anonymized IP addresses"
  - "Successful login following guessing attempts"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Password Guessing Behavior"
    query: >
      event.type == "authentication_failure" AND
      count(distinct user.name) BY source.ip WITHIN 10 minutes > 10

  - name: "Successful Login Following Password Guessing"
    query: >
      event.type == "authentication_success" AND
      previous_events(event.type == "authentication_failure" AND source.ip == current.source.ip) > 5 WITHIN 30 minutes

automation_hooks:
  - "Block or throttle IPs exhibiting password guessing."
  - "Force password reset for affected accounts."
  - "Trigger MFA enforcement on targeted accounts."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Assess the scope and impact of guessing attempts."
  - "Check for credential stuffing or other follow-up attacks."
  - "Strengthen authentication controls and monitoring."
