playbook_name: "T1555.003 - Cloud Storage Credential Access Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1555.003"
technique_name: "Cloud Storage Credential Access"
description: >
  Detect attempts to access credentials stored in cloud storage services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager).

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to Cloud Credential Stores"
    description: >
      Detect suspicious access or download attempts to cloud secrets or credential vaults.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected accesses to cloud secrets or vault services?"
      - "Is there unusual API activity targeting secret management endpoints?"
    data_sources:
      - "Cloud audit logs"
      - "API gateway logs"
      - "Cloud provider security logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Compromised or Stolen Credentials"
    description: >
      Identify unauthorized usage of credentials to access cloud storage or secrets.
    checklist:
      - "Are there login anomalies or impossible travel detections?"
      - "Is there use of API keys or tokens from unusual IPs or regions?"
    data_sources:
      - "Cloud access logs"
      - "Identity provider logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Data Exfiltration or Privilege Escalation"
    description: >
      Look for suspicious data transfers or privilege changes after credential access.
    checklist:
      - "Is there unusual data download or copying activity?"
      - "Are new roles or permissions granted suspiciously?"
    data_sources:
      - "Cloud storage logs"
      - "IAM change logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known or scheduled credential access."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access without confirmed exfiltration."
      - "High: Confirmed credential theft and data exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Anomalous API calls or credential usage."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access patterns."
      - "Low: Possible benign activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Unauthorized API calls to secret management services"
  - "Suspicious logins or token usage"
  - "Unusual data exfiltration from cloud storage"

  - "Validate access legitimacy with user/business context."
  - "Review for subsequent privilege escalation or exfiltration."
  - "Revoke compromised credentials and rotate secrets."
