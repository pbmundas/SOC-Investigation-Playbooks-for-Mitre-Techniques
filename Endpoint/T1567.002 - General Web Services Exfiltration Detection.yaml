description: >
  Detect data exfiltration through general web services such as social media, pastebins, or other online platforms.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Uploads to General Web Services"
    description: >
      Identify suspicious or large uploads to non-cloud-storage web services.
    checklist:
      - "Are uploads occurring to social media, pastebin, or file-sharing sites?"
      - "Is upload timing or volume unusual?"
      - "Are connections to suspicious or rare domains observed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Proxy logs"
      - "Web filtering logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate with Endpoint File and Process Activity"
    description: >
      Look for files staged or prepared for upload and processes managing uploads.
    checklist:
      - "Are suspicious or unauthorized processes uploading data?"
      - "Are there files recently accessed or compressed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Review Account Activity on Web Services"
    description: >
      Check for unauthorized or abnormal use of web accounts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new account creations or access from unusual IPs?"
      - "Is there evidence of automation or scripted uploads?"
    data_sources:
      - "Web service audit logs"
      - "SIEM alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal business usage."
      - "Medium: Suspicious upload patterns."
      - "High: Confirmed data exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: IOC or validated events."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious upload domains"
  - "Unusual endpoint activity"
  - "Web account anomalies"
