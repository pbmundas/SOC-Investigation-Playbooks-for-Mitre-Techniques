playbook_name: "T1056.003 - Web Input Capture Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1056.003"
technique_name: "Web Input Capture"
description: >
  Detects adversaries capturing input data via web forms or browsers by using malicious scripts or browser extensions.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Malicious Browser Extensions or Scripts"
    description: >
      Detect installation or execution of suspicious browser extensions or injected scripts that capture web input.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unknown or unsigned browser extensions installed?"
      - "Is there evidence of script injection in web pages?"
    data_sources:
      - "Browser logs"
      - "Web proxy logs"
      - "Endpoint monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor Network Traffic for Captured Input Data"
    description: >
      Detect outbound transmission of captured input data such as form entries or credentials.
    checklist:
      - "Is input data sent to suspicious or unknown endpoints?"
      - "Are there anomalous POST requests or webhooks?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "Proxy logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Web Input Capture with Credential Access or Exfiltration"
    description: >
      Investigate if captured input data is used for unauthorized access or exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Is there login activity using captured credentials?"
      - "Are there data exfiltration events following web input capture?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized browser extensions or scripts."
      - "Medium: Suspicious web input capture activity."
      - "High: Malicious web input capture linked to credential theft or espionage."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious web input capture and credential use."
      - "Medium: Detection of suspicious browser activity."
      - "Low: Legitimate browser extension use."

ioc_types:
  - "Installation of suspicious browser extensions"
  - "Injected scripts capturing web form data"
  - "Outbound network traffic with captured inputs"
