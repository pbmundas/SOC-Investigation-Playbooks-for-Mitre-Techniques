playbook_name: "T1083 - File and Directory Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1083"
technique_name: "File and Directory Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries enumerating files and directories on systems to locate valuable information, credentials, or further attack vectors.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor File and Directory Enumeration Commands"
    description: >
      Identify usage of commands and tools (e.g., dir, ls, Get-ChildItem, cmdlets) for file and directory discovery.
    checklist:
      - "Are file/directory enumeration commands executed by suspicious users?"
      - "Are scripting tools used to recursively list files?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Unusual or Large-Scale File Enumeration Activity"
    description: >
      Look for excessive or automated file enumeration outside of normal operations.
    checklist:
      - "Are there recursive directory listing commands or scripts?"
      - "Is file enumeration performed from unusual hosts or accounts?"
    data_sources:
      - "User activity logs"
      - "Endpoint monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate File Discovery with Credential Access or Data Exfiltration"
    description: >
      Determine if file and directory discovery precedes attempts to access sensitive files or exfiltrate data.
    checklist:
      - "Is file enumeration followed by access to credential files?"
      - "Are suspicious outbound network connections observed afterward?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: File enumeration by authorized users."
      - "Medium: Enumeration by unknown or suspicious accounts."
      - "High: File discovery linked to credential theft or data breach."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized file/directory discovery."
      - "Medium: Suspicious activity requiring further context."
      - "Low: Routine system maintenance."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of dir, ls, Get-ChildItem commands"
  - "Recursive file listing scripts"
  - "Access to directories containing sensitive files"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect dir or ls Command Usage"
    query: >
      (process.name == "cmd.exe" AND process.command_line CONTAINS "dir") OR
      (process.name == "bash" AND process.command_line CONTAINS "ls")

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Recursive Directory Listing"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-ChildItem.*-Recurse"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious file and directory enumeration."
  - "Limit recursive directory listing commands."
  - "Monitor for access to sensitive files post-enumeration."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate file discovery intent and user privileges."
  - "Correlate with other suspicious activities or alerts."
  - "Recommend file system permission reviews and controls."
