playbook_name: "T1003 - Credential Dumping Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1003"
technique_name: "Credential Dumping"
description: >
  Detect attempts to extract account credentials from operating systems or software.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Use of Known Credential Dumping Tools"
    description: >
      Monitor execution of tools commonly used for credential dumping (e.g., Mimikatz).
    checklist:
      - "Are known credential dumping tools executed?"
      - "Is there evidence of process injection or memory scraping?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Endpoint detection alerts"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor Access to Credential Stores"
    description: >
      Detect unauthorized access or dumping of LSASS, SAM, NTDS, keychains, or caches.
    checklist:
      - "Is LSASS or similar process memory accessed or dumped?"
      - "Are security database files read or copied unexpectedly?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process memory access logs"
      - "File system access logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Analyze Network Activity for Credential Theft"
    description: >
      Correlate credential dumping with lateral movement or exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Is there suspicious SMB, RDP, or other credential-based connections?"
      - "Are credentials used on multiple hosts abnormally?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Authentication logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: False positive or authorized admin activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious credential access detected."
      - "High: Confirmed credential dumping and use."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known tool execution with suspicious activity."
      - "Medium: Unusual memory or file access."
      - "Low: Ambiguous or benign activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of credential dumping tools"
  - "Memory dumps of LSASS or SAM"
  - "Unauthorized access to credential stores"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Mimikatz Execution"
    query: >
      process.name:"mimikatz.exe" OR process.command_line:"*sekurlsa*"
  - name: "Detect LSASS Memory Access"
    query: >
      event.type:"ProcessAccess" AND target.process.name:"lsass.exe"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on execution of credential dumping tools."
  - "Block suspicious process memory reads if possible."
  - "Trigger incident response for confirmed dumping."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if activity is from authorized personnel."
  - "Review endpoint and network logs for lateral movement."
  - "Contain and remediate affected systems immediately."
