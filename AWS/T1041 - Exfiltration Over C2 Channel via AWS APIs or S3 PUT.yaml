playbook_name: "T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel via AWS APIs or S3 PUT"
tactic: "Exfiltration"
technique_id: "T1041"
technique_name: "Exfiltration Over C2 Channel"
description: >
  Detect and investigate data exfiltration attempts using AWS APIs, AWS CLI commands, or S3 PUT operations.
  Attackers may use these channels to covertly transfer data out of the environment, often blending with legitimate traffic.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor S3 PUT Requests for Data Uploads"
    description: >
      Analyze S3 PUT events for unusual or large data uploads that may indicate exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Are there uploads to uncommon or newly created buckets?"
      - "Are large files being uploaded in short timeframes?"
      - "Are PUT requests originating from unexpected IAM roles or IP addresses?"
    data_sources:
      - "S3 Access Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "VPC Flow Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Suspicious AWS API or CLI Exfiltration Commands"
    description: >
      Review CloudTrail and CLI logs for commands or API calls that can be used to extract data or send it outside the environment.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual or unauthorized API calls for data retrieval or transfer?"
      - "Are CLI commands run with elevated privileges or by unexpected users?"
      - "Is there use of automation scripts for mass data extraction?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "AWS CLI Command Logs"
      - "EDR or Endpoint Logs on EC2 instances"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Data Exfiltration Activities with Other Indicators"
    description: >
      Cross-reference exfiltration signs with other suspicious behaviors such as compromised credentials or persistence mechanisms.
    checklist:
      - "Are data uploads preceded by privilege escalation or lateral movement?"
      - "Is there evidence of compromised IAM roles or keys?"
      - "Are there simultaneous network connections to external or suspicious endpoints?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "IAM Access Logs"
      - "Network Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized data uploads by known applications."
      - "Medium: Unusual data transfer activity needing review."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious data exfiltration attempt."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear unauthorized data upload with attacker context."
      - "Medium: Suspicious activity with some indicators of compromise."
      - "Low: Routine uploads with minor anomalies."

ioc_types:
  - "S3 PUT requests to unknown or newly created buckets"
  - "Unusual or unauthorized AWS API calls for data extraction"
  - "CLI commands running mass data export or upload scripts"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Large S3 PUT Uploads"
    query: >
      s3_access_logs: eventName="PutObject" AND objectSize > 100000000
  - name: "Suspicious AWS CLI Data Extraction"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventName IN ("GetObject", "ListObjects") AND userAgent LIKE "%aws-cli%"
  - name: "Unusual Data Transfer API Calls"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventName IN ("PutObject", "UploadPart") AND sourceIPAddress NOT IN trusted_ips

automation_hooks:
  - "Trigger alerts on large or frequent S3 PUT operations by unknown entities."
  - "Automatically revoke or rotate IAM keys used in suspicious data transfers."
  - "Initiate network isolation or session termination on compromised EC2 instances."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify whether the data transfers align with business processes or known workflows."
  - "Correlate exfiltration attempts with other attacker activity such as credential theft."
  - "Recommend tightening IAM policies and implementing encryption for sensitive data."
