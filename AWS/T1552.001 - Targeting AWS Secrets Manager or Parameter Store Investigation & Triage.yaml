playbook_name: "T1552.001 - Targeting AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1552.001"
technique_name: "Targeting AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store"
description: >
  Detect attempts to access or enumerate secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store, which may indicate credential theft or preparation for lateral movement.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor API Calls to Secrets Manager and Parameter Store"
    description: >
      Track usage of GetSecretValue, ListSecrets, GetParameters, and other related API calls.
    checklist:
      - "Are there excessive or unusual API calls to Secrets Manager or Parameter Store?"
      - "Are requests coming from unusual users, roles, or IP addresses?"
      - "Is there usage of new or unauthorized roles accessing secrets?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail (GetSecretValue, ListSecrets, GetParameters)"
      - "AWS Config"
      - "IAM access logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Review Access Patterns and Source"
    description: >
      Analyze the identity and context from which secrets are accessed.
    checklist:
      - "Is the access time or frequency anomalous?"
      - "Is the API access from unusual geographic locations or IP addresses?"
      - "Are the accesses clustered around other suspicious activities?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail logs"
      - "Authentication metadata"
      - "Network logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Potential Compromise Indicators"
    description: >
      Look for related suspicious actions such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, or disabling of logging.
    checklist:
      - "Are there changes to IAM roles or policies shortly before or after secret access?"
      - "Is there evidence of data exfiltration or unusual resource use?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "IAM logs"
      - "Network monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Routine or authorized secret access."
      - "Medium: Unusual or high-volume secret access."
      - "High: Unauthorized or suspicious secret access linked to compromise."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known attacker IP or compromised user accessing secrets."
      - "Medium: Anomalous access patterns without clear intent."
      - "Low: Possibly legitimate automation or service accounts."

ioc_types:
  - "API calls to GetSecretValue or GetParameters from unexpected principals"
  - "High-frequency secret access events"
  - "Unusual geographic or temporal access patterns"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect GetSecretValue API Calls"
    query: >
      eventName="GetSecretValue"
  - name: "Detect Unusual Access to Parameter Store"
    query: >
      eventName="GetParameters" AND sourceIPAddress NOT IN (trusted IPs)

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on high-volume or anomalous secret access."
  - "Throttle or block suspicious API calls."
  - "Trigger secret rotation and incident response."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if access aligns with legitimate automation or admin tasks."
  - "Investigate associated IAM activity and network traffic."
  - "Rotate secrets and audit associated accounts promptly if suspicious."
