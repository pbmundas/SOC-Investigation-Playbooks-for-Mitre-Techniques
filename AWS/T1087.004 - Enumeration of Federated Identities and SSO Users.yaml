playbook_name: "T1087.004 - Enumeration of Federated Identities and SSO Users"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1087.004"
technique_name: "Account Discovery: Cloud Account"
description: >
  Detect attempts to enumerate AWS SSO users, AzureAD/SAML federated identities, and trust relationships 
  configured for federated access. Attackers may use this to identify indirect privilege escalation paths.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Use of ListAccounts and ListUsers (SSO)"
    description: >
      Monitor API calls from identities listing AWS SSO or Identity Center accounts and users.
    checklist:
      - "Are ListUsers/ListAccounts called by a non-SSO admin?"
      - "Are calls made using new/unknown identity providers?"
      - "Are login attempts seen for newly listed users?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "AWS Identity Center (SSO) logs"
      - "IAM Access Analyzer"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Investigate Trust Relationships with External IdPs"
    description: >
      Identify newly added or altered identity providers and associated trust policies.
    checklist:
      - "Are new SAML providers or OpenID Connect providers added?"
      - "Did any role trust policies change recently?"
      - "Any federated user assumed roles from unusual locations?"
    data_sources:
      - "IAM Policy changes (CloudTrail)"
      - "STS AssumeRoleWithSAML or AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity events"
      - "GuardDuty for federated access anomalies"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Admin listing for audit or sync."
      - "Medium: External identity listing federated users."
      - "High: Trust policy change followed by unexpected AssumeRole."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Enumeration confirmed with follow-up abuse."
      - "Medium: Unknown IP performing trust changes."
      - "Low: Normal activity from provisioning script."

ioc_types:
  - "ListUsers in identitystore.amazonaws.com"
  - "IAM CreateIdentityProvider or UpdateTrustPolicy API events"
  - "AssumeRoleWithSAML from unfamiliar SAML issuer"

queries/examples:
  - name: "SSO Enumeration Detection"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventSource=identitystore.amazonaws.com AND eventName=ListUsers
  - name: "Federation Trust Policy Changes"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventName IN (CreateIdentityProvider, UpdateTrustPolicy, UpdateRoleTrustPolicy)

automation_hooks:
  - "Flag and review all external SAML/OIDC providers."
  - "Auto-alert when new identity provider is created."
  - "Initiate trust boundary review upon identity listing."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Determine if SSO or federated identity enumeration was authorized."
  - "Check if federated role was used for lateral movement."
  - "Use IP, device, and geo-location to detect external actor access."
