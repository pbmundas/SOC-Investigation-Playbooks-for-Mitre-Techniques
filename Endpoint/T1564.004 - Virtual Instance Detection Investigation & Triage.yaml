playbook_name: "T1564.004 - Virtual Instance Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1564.004"
technique_name: "Virtual Instance"
description: >
  Detect attempts by adversaries to evade defenses or detection by running their malware or tools inside virtualized environments or sandbox instances.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Virtualization Artifacts"
    description: >
      Detect indicators of virtual machines (VMs) or sandbox environments such as registry keys, drivers, or processes typically associated with virtualization.
    checklist:
      - "Are there VM-specific processes or services running?"
      - "Are known VM device drivers or services loaded?"
      - "Are system BIOS or hardware characteristics indicative of virtualization?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint telemetry"
      - "Process and driver inventories"
      - "Hardware/BIOS scan logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor for Anti-VM Evasion Techniques"
    description: >
      Detect code or behavior attempting to detect or evade virtual environments.
    checklist:
      - "Are scripts or executables querying VM-specific artifacts?"
      - "Is there evidence of execution path changes based on environment detection?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Script and command line logging"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Malicious Activity"
    description: >
      Assess whether presence inside a virtual instance correlates with malware execution or evasion.
    checklist:
      - "Does activity stop or change when VM is detected?"
      - "Are malicious payloads dropped or executed only outside VM?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint behavior logs"
      - "Threat intel"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Harden Detection"
    description: >
      Adjust sandbox configurations or endpoint monitoring to detect evasive behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Improve detection for anti-VM techniques."
      - "Notify IR team if evasion detected."
    data_sources:
      - "Sandbox logs"
      - "Endpoint telemetry"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate use of virtual instances."
      - "Medium: Suspicious VM evasion behavior."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious anti-VM evasion."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear indicators of evasion."
      - "Medium: Potential evasion."
      - "Low: Benign VM usage."

ioc_types:
  - "VM-related processes and drivers"
  - "VM environment queries in command lines"
  - "Anti-VM detection artifacts"
