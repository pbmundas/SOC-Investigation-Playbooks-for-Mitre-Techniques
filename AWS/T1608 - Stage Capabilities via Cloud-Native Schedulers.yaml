playbook_name: "T1608 - Stage Capabilities via Cloud-Native Schedulers"
tactic: "Execution"
technique_id: "T1608"
technique_name: "Stage Capabilities"
description: >
  Detect and investigate the use of cloud-native schedulers such as AWS CloudWatch Events
  or Lambda triggers for staging and automating attack capabilities, persistence,
  or operational tasks within the AWS environment.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Creation and Modification of CloudWatch Event Rules and Lambda Triggers"
    description: >
      Identify the creation or modification of scheduled event rules and Lambda triggers that
      may be used to stage malicious payloads or automate attacker actions.
    checklist:
      - "Are new CloudWatch Event rules or Lambda triggers created outside of normal maintenance windows?"
      - "Are scheduled jobs configured to invoke suspicious Lambda functions or workflows?"
      - "Are the creators or modifiers authorized and following internal policies?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail Logs"
      - "AWS Config"
      - "CloudWatch Events Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Execution Patterns of Scheduled Events and Lambda Invocations"
    description: >
      Review execution logs to detect unusual frequency or timing of scheduled events that
      might indicate attacker automation or persistence mechanisms.
    checklist:
      - "Is there an abnormal increase in scheduled Lambda function executions?"
      - "Are scheduled events invoking functions that access sensitive resources?"
      - "Do execution times or intervals deviate from documented business processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudWatch Logs"
      - "Lambda Execution Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Validate Permissions and Configurations for Scheduled Jobs"
    description: >
      Check the permissions and configurations associated with scheduled jobs to ensure they adhere to
      least privilege principles and have not been altered maliciously.
    checklist:
      - "Are IAM roles associated with scheduled events configured with least privilege?"
      - "Have targets or inputs of scheduled jobs been modified unexpectedly?"
      - "Is there evidence of role misuse or privilege escalation through scheduled jobs?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS Config"
      - "IAM Access Analyzer"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Scheduled jobs created and maintained by authorized personnel."
      - "Medium: Suspicious scheduled jobs with incomplete validation."
      - "High: Unauthorized or malicious scheduled jobs detected."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed malicious use of scheduled events for attacker persistence."
      - "Medium: Indicators of suspicious scheduling activity."
      - "Low: Routine scheduling with minor anomalies."

ioc_types:
  - "Creation/modification of CloudWatch Event rules by unauthorized users"
  - "Lambda triggers set for suspicious automated execution"
  - "Unusual scheduling and execution frequency or timing"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized creation or modification of scheduled events."
  - "Trigger reviews for suspicious scheduled Lambda invocations."
  - "Enforce IAM policy audits for scheduled job permissions."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm scheduling actions align with documented operational processes."
  - "Correlate scheduled jobs with other suspicious activity indicators."
  - "Recommend tightening of scheduling permissions and continuous monitoring."
