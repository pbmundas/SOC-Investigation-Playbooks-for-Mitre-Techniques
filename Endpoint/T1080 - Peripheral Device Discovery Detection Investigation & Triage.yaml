playbook_name: "T1080 - Peripheral Device Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1080"
technique_name: "Peripheral Device Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries attempting to identify connected peripheral devices (USB drives, printers, cameras, etc.) on a system to plan data exfiltration or further exploitation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Queries or Commands Enumerating Peripheral Devices"
    description: >
      Monitor usage of system utilities or commands that list connected devices (e.g., 'lsusb', 'Get-PnpDevice').
    checklist:
      - "Are commands executed to list connected peripherals?"
      - "Are these commands run by non-administrative or suspicious users?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command line auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Access to Device Driver or USB Device Information"
    description: >
      Look for file or registry queries related to device drivers or USB device configurations.
    checklist:
      - "Are there accesses to device driver files or registry keys?"
      - "Is the access correlated with suspicious user or process activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Registry access logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Peripheral Discovery with Other Reconnaissance or Data Exfiltration"
    description: >
      Determine if peripheral device discovery is followed by copying data or USB device usage.
    checklist:
      - "Is there data transfer to removable media shortly after discovery?"
      - "Are there indications of lateral movement or suspicious uploads?"
    data_sources:
      - "USB device logs"
      - "File transfer logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Discovery by authorized admins."
      - "Medium: Peripheral discovery in restricted environments."
      - "High: Discovery preceding data exfiltration or unauthorized USB use."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed peripheral enumeration commands."
      - "Medium: Suspicious device driver or registry queries."
      - "Low: Routine system checks."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of device enumeration commands (lsusb, Get-PnpDevice)"
  - "Access to USB device registry keys or driver files"
  - "Unusual USB device mount or usage"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect PowerShell Peripheral Device Queries"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-PnpDevice|Get-WmiObject Win32_USBControllerDevice"

  - name: "Detect USB Registry Key Access"
    query: >
      registry.key_path CONTAINS "SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\USB"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized peripheral enumeration commands."
  - "Restrict access to USB device registry keys."
  - "Monitor USB device mounts and file transfers."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm legitimacy of device enumeration activity."
  - "Investigate USB device usage and data transfers."
  - "Recommend policies restricting USB device usage."
