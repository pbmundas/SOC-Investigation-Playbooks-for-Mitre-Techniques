playbook_name: "T1609 - Network Denial of Service Detection"
tactic: "Impact"
technique_id: "T1609"
technique_name: "Network Denial of Service"
description: >
  Detect adversaries performing attacks to degrade or interrupt network-based services and resources.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Abnormal Network Traffic Volumes"
    description: >
      Identify spikes in network usage potentially indicative of DoS attacks.
    checklist:
      - "Is there a sudden and sustained spike in inbound traffic?"
      - "Are there large volumes of SYN, UDP, ICMP, or DNS requests?"
      - "Are known DoS patterns (e.g., SYN flood, Smurf) observed?"
    data_sources:
      - "NetFlow logs"
      - "Firewall and IDS/IPS logs"
      - "Load balancer metrics"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Determine Source and Type of Attack"
    description: >
      Examine if traffic originates from a single source or distributed (DDoS).
    checklist:
      - "Are many IPs targeting the same service or system?"
      - "Are spoofed IPs involved?"
    data_sources:
      - "Firewall and WAF logs"
      - "NDR tools"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Assess Impact on Services and Availability"
    description: >
      Validate service degradation or unavailability.
    checklist:
      - "Are services (e.g., web, DNS, VPN) responding as expected?"
      - "Are legitimate users reporting access issues?"
    data_sources:
      - "Service monitoring tools"
      - "User complaints/tickets"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Medium: Detected abnormal traffic, no outage."
      - "High: Confirmed service disruption."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Validated attack with impact."
      - "Medium: Strong indicators."
      - "Low: Traffic anomaly, unconfirmed."

ioc_types:
  - "Massive inbound SYN/UDP/ICMP traffic"
  - "Same port targeted across systems"
  - "High connection failure rates"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Spike in SYN Packets (Firewall)"
    query: >
      event.type = "network" AND protocol = "TCP" AND flags = "SYN" AND
      count(src_ip) > threshold_value

automation_hooks:
  - "Trigger rate-limiting rules on firewall/load balancer"
  - "Notify network team"
  - "Enable DDoS protection mechanisms"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate affected systems/services."
  - "Engage with ISP or cloud provider if necessary."
  - "Update IPS signatures and block offending IPs."
