playbook_name: "T1495 - Firmware Corruption Detection"
tactic: "Impact"
technique_id: "T1495"
technique_name: "Firmware Corruption"
description: >
  Detect attempts to corrupt or manipulate firmware to disrupt system or device operations.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Firmware Integrity"
    description: >
      Detect changes or corruption in device or system firmware.
    checklist:
      - "Are firmware checksums or hashes mismatched?"
      - "Are firmware update logs showing unexpected changes?"
      - "Are unauthorized firmware update tools or commands executed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Firmware integrity checks"
      - "System event logs"
      - "Endpoint security telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Suspicious Firmware Update Activities"
    description: >
      Identify unplanned or unauthorized firmware updates or tampering attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Are firmware updates scheduled outside normal maintenance windows?"
      - "Are unknown processes attempting firmware writes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Update management system logs"
      - "Process command-line monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with System Instability or Failures"
    description: >
      Investigate if firmware corruption correlates with device malfunctions.
    checklist:
      - "Are devices rebooting unexpectedly?"
      - "Are system errors or crashes occurring after firmware changes?"
    data_sources:
      - "System health monitoring"
      - "EDR and hardware logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Medium: Suspicious firmware activity."
      - "High: Confirmed firmware corruption."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified firmware tampering."
      - "Medium: Anomalous firmware events."
      - "Low: False positives due to legitimate updates."

ioc_types:
  - "Firmware checksum mismatches"
  - "Unauthorized firmware write attempts"
  - "Unexpected firmware update logs"
