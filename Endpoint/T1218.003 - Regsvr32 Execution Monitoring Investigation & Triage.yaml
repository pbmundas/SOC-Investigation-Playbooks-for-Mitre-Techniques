technique_name: "Regsvr32 Execution Monitoring"
description: >
  Detect abuse of regsvr32.exe (Microsoft Register Server) to execute malicious scripts or DLLs.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Regsvr32 Execution"
    description: >
      Monitor for regsvr32.exe executions, especially with scriptlet (.sct) files or unusual DLLs.
    checklist:
      - "Are scripts (.sct) or unusual DLLs loaded via regsvr32?"
      - "Is regsvr32.exe invoked by non-standard users/processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command line auditing"
      - "File system monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Command Line Arguments"
    description: >
      Identify suspicious command line parameters, remote script loads, or persistence mechanisms.
    checklist:
      - "Is regsvr32 used to execute remote scripts?"
      - "Is regsvr32 running unsigned or suspicious DLLs?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process command line"
      - "Network telemetry"
      - "File hashes"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Threat Intelligence and Other Events"
    description: >
      Cross-check against known malicious payloads and associated attacker activity.
    checklist:
      - "Are command lines or hashes matching threat intel?"
      - "Are other signs of compromise present?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intel feeds"
      - "SIEM logs"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Response"
    description: >
      Block or restrict regsvr32 usage for non-admin users, isolate affected systems.
    checklist:
      - "Apply application whitelisting."
      - "Engage IR to contain and remediate."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "IR tools"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate regsvr32 usage."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or anomalous usage."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious abuse."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious regsvr32 execution."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but incomplete."
      - "Low: Benign or authorized use."

ioc_types:
  - "Regsvr32 command lines with .sct or remote scripts"
  - "Unusual DLL loads"
  - "Known malicious hashes"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Regsvr32 executing .sct scripts"
    query: >
      process.name:regsvr32.exe AND process.command_line:*.sct
  - name: "Regsvr32 executing remote script"

      process.name:regsvr32.exe AND process.command_line:*http*://*

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious regsvr32 command lines."
  - "Trigger enrichment and analyst review."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify context and legitimacy."
  - "Investigate associated processes and network."
  - "Escalate to IR if abuse suspected."
