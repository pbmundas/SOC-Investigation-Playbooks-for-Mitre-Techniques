playbook_name: "T1570 - Tool Transfer Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1570"
technique_name: "Lateral Tool Transfer"
description: >
  Detects adversaries transferring tools or utilities between systems to facilitate further actions such as credential access or lateral movement.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify File Transfer Activity"
    description: >
      Monitor network and host file transfer activities, focusing on uncommon protocols or unusual file types.
    checklist:
      - "Are there file transfers involving known attacker tools or suspicious executables?"
      - "Is there transfer of files to systems where the user does not normally operate?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "File system audit logs"
      - "Endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Common Transfer Methods"
    description: >
      Observe use of SMB, FTP, HTTP, PowerShell, or other scripting methods to move tools.
    checklist:
      - "Is there unusual use of SMB or administrative shares?"
      - "Are there script executions for file downloads or uploads?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network flow logs"
      - "PowerShell/command execution logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Tool Transfer with Subsequent Actions"
    description: >
      Investigate activities after tool transfer such as execution, credential dumping, or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Is the transferred tool executed soon after transfer?"
      - "Are there suspicious authentication attempts after transfer?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs"
      - "Authentication logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate file transfer activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious transfers needing validation."
      - "High: Confirmed adversary tool transfer."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious tool transfer and execution."
      - "Medium: Suspicious transfer without execution confirmation."
      - "Low: Routine file transfers."

ioc_types:
  - "File transfers via SMB or FTP with unusual filenames"
  - "Scripted downloads/uploads of tools"
  - "Execution of newly transferred files"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect SMB File Transfers of Executables"
    query: >
      network.protocol == SMB AND
      file.extension IN (".exe", ".dll", ".ps1", ".bat") AND
      NOT file.name IN approved list

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Download Commands"
    query: >
      powershell.command_line CONTAINS "Invoke-WebRequest" OR "wget"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious file transfer events."
  - "Block execution of newly transferred suspicious files."
  - "Notify SOC team for incident response."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify legitimacy of file transfers and user activity."
  - "Monitor execution and behavioral indicators post-transfer."
  - "Recommend network segmentation and file transfer controls."
