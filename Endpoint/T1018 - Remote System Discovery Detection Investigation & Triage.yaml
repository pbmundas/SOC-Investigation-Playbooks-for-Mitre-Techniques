playbook_name: "T1018 - Remote System Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1018"
technique_name: "Remote System Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries scanning or querying remote systems on a network to identify potential targets for lateral movement or exploitation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Network Scanning and Remote Discovery Tools"
    description: >
      Identify use of tools or commands such as `ping`, `nbtstat`, `net view`, `arp`, Nmap, or PowerShell cmdlets scanning or enumerating remote systems.
    checklist:
      - "Are network discovery or scanning commands detected?"
      - "Are scans conducted by unauthorized or unusual accounts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Anomalous Remote System Enumeration Activity"
    description: >
      Look for scanning of multiple hosts or IP ranges within a short time frame.
    checklist:
      - "Is scanning targeting critical or sensitive network segments?"
      - "Are scans performed outside normal operational hours?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network flow logs"
      - "User activity monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Remote System Discovery with Follow-up Activities"
    description: >
      Assess if remote system discovery is followed by lateral movement, exploitation, or data exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of credential use or connection attempts to discovered hosts?"
      - "Are there related alerts for privilege escalation or malware?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection logs"
      - "Authentication and access logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Network scans by authorized personnel."
      - "Medium: Unusual scanning by standard users."
      - "High: Scanning linked to active intrusion or compromise."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized remote system scanning."
      - "Medium: Suspicious scanning activity."
      - "Low: Routine network administration."

ioc_types:
  - "Use of `ping`, `nbtstat`, `net view`, `arp`, or Nmap"
  - "PowerShell remote discovery cmdlets"
  - "Scanning from suspicious accounts or hosts"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect nbtstat Command"
    query: >
      process.name == "nbtstat.exe"

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Network Scanning"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Test-Connection|Invoke-Command|Get-NetNeighbor"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized network scanning or enumeration."
  - "Limit scanning tools access to authorized users."
  - "Investigate scanning origin and user context."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if remote system discovery is authorized."
  - "Correlate with lateral movement or exploitation attempts."
  - "Recommend monitoring and restricting scanning tools."
