playbook_name: "T1213 - Data from Information Repositories (S3, DynamoDB, RDS)"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1213"
technique_name: "Data from Information Repositories"
description: >
  Detect and investigate unauthorized or suspicious access to cloud-based
  information repositories such as AWS S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, and RDS
  databases that could indicate data theft, reconnaissance, or exfiltration attempts.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to S3 Buckets"
    description: >
      Track API calls and access patterns to S3 buckets, focusing on unusual
      reads, writes, and permission changes.
    checklist:
      - "Are there any access attempts from unexpected IP addresses or identities?"
      - "Have there been recent changes to bucket policies or ACLs?"
      - "Are there bulk data download or listing operations that deviate from normal?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "S3 Server Access Logs"
      - "AWS Config"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor Access to DynamoDB Tables"
    description: >
      Investigate query, scan, and data modification operations on DynamoDB
      tables, paying attention to abnormal access.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unauthorized or anomalous scans or queries?"
      - "Are IAM roles accessing DynamoDB recently changed or escalated?"
      - "Are large-scale data access operations observed?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "DynamoDB Streams"
      - "AWS Config"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Monitor Access to RDS Databases"
    description: >
      Review connection logs and query executions on RDS instances to identify
      unauthorized access or abnormal activity.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected connection attempts from unknown IP addresses?"
      - "Are privileged queries executed by unauthorized users?"
      - "Is there evidence of bulk data extraction or export?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "RDS Audit Logs"
      - "VPC Flow Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal access with authorized identities."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access patterns without full proof."
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized access or data exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear evidence of unauthorized access."
      - "Medium: Indicators of anomalous behavior."
      - "Low: Access consistent with routine business operations."

ioc_types:
  - "Access from unrecognized or unauthorized IPs"
  - "Unexpected permission modifications on repositories"
  - "Large data retrieval or export events"

queries/examples:
  - name: "S3 Bucket Access Outside Normal IP Range"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventSource="s3.amazonaws.com" AND (eventName="GetObject" OR eventName="ListBucket") AND sourceIPAddress NOT IN trusted_ip_list
  - name: "Anomalous DynamoDB Table Scans"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventSource="dynamodb.amazonaws.com" AND eventName IN ("Scan", "Query") AND userIdentity.sessionContext.sessionIssuer.userName NOT IN trusted_users
  - name: "RDS Unusual Database Connections"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventSource="rds.amazonaws.com" AND eventName="Connect" AND sourceIPAddress NOT IN trusted_ip_list

automation_hooks:
  - "Trigger alerts on suspicious repository access from unknown sources."
  - "Initiate IAM role and policy audits after anomalous activity."
  - "Throttle large or suspicious data transfers pending investigation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm the identity and intent of the accessing user or role."
  - "Review recent changes in IAM permissions or policies."
  - "Correlate access events with business workflows."
  - "Investigate possible data exfiltration or abuse."
