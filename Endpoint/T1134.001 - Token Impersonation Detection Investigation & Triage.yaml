playbook_name: "T1134.001 - Token Impersonation Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Privilege Escalation"
technique_id: "T1134.001"
technique_name: "Token Impersonation"
description: >
  Detect and investigate token impersonation where adversaries use a stolen token to impersonate another user or service.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect ImpersonateNamedPipeClient and SetThreadToken"
    description: >
      Monitor impersonation-related API usage in low-privilege contexts.
    checklist:
      - "Are these APIs used outside normal authentication?"
      - "Are low-privilege users impersonating SYSTEM or admins?"
    data_sources:
      - "API telemetry"
      - "Thread-level monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Check for Lateral Movement Indicators"
    description: >
      Analyze if impersonation is followed by access to remote resources.
    checklist:
      - "Are admin shares or privileged services accessed?"
      - "Are impersonated tokens reused across machines?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network access logs"
      - "Windows Event Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Validate Token Ownership and Use Context"
    description: >
      Investigate if the token is legitimate and whether its usage context is valid.
    checklist:
      - "Does the token source align with user session?"
      - "Are impersonated actions logged in user context?"
    data_sources:
      - "Security logs"
      - "Authentication systems"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Confirm and Respond"
    description: >
      Corroborate impersonation evidence and respond.
    checklist:
      - "Is impersonation part of larger attack pattern?"
      - "Is isolation or session termination needed?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM alerts"
      - "IR case notes"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Internal service impersonation."
      - "Medium: Suspicious impersonation in isolated context."
      - "High: Token misuse to gain unauthorized access."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Strong correlation with lateral movement."
      - "Medium: Unusual API usage but unclear intent."
      - "Low: Rare or benign impersonation."

ioc_types:
  - "Impersonation API usage"
  - "Token ownership anomalies"
  - "Cross-session impersonation"
