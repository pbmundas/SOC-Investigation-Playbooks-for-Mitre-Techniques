playbook_name: "T1039 - Network Shared Drive Data Access Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1039"
technique_name: "Network Shared Drive Data Access"
description: >
  Detects adversaries accessing data on network shared drives to collect sensitive information or facilitate lateral movement.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to Network Shared Drives"
    description: >
      Identify file access events on network shares, focusing on unusual user accounts or high-volume access.
    checklist:
      - "Are there file read or write operations on network shares by non-standard accounts?"
      - "Is there an unusual volume or pattern of file access?"
    data_sources:
      - "File server access logs"
      - "Network share auditing logs"
      - "Endpoint file access logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Unusual Data Access Patterns"
    description: >
      Look for bulk file copying or accessing sensitive directories that are not typical for the user.
    checklist:
      - "Is data accessed outside normal business hours?"
      - "Are large numbers of files accessed or copied?"
      - "Is sensitive data being accessed without proper authorization?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access metadata"
      - "Data Loss Prevention (DLP) logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Intrusion Indicators"
    description: >
      Check if network share access correlates with other suspicious activities such as credential use anomalies or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Is there concurrent suspicious login or privilege escalation?"
      - "Are there related alerts for malware or suspicious processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"
      - "SIEM correlation rules"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized access by known users."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access pattern requiring investigation."
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized data access on network shares."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified unauthorized access and potential data theft."
      - "Medium: Unusual access pattern without confirmed intent."
      - "Low: Routine access activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to network shares from unusual user accounts or endpoints"
  - "High volume or off-hours file access"
  - "Access to sensitive or restricted shared folders"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Large Volume Access to Network Shares"
    query: >
      file.access_count > 100 WITHIN 10 minutes AND
      network_share.accessed == true

  - name: "Detect Network Share Access Outside Business Hours"
    query: >
      file.access_time NOT BETWEEN ("08:00", "18:00") AND
      network_share.accessed == true

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious network share access."
  - "Block or restrict access from anomalous users or endpoints."
  - "Notify data owners and security teams for incident handling."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate user authorization and business need for access."
  - "Review related login and process activity for compromise."
  - "Enforce network share access controls and monitoring."
