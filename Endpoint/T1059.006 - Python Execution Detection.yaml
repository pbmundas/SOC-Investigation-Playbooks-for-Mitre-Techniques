tactic: "Execution"

technique_name: "Python"
description: >
  Detects execution of Python interpreters that may be abused to run malicious scripts or payloads in compromised systems.

detection_sources:
  - Sysmon (Event ID 1 on Windows)
  - Linux Auditd or Sysmon for Linux
  - EDR telemetry
  - Command-line logs

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Python Interpreter Usage"
    checklist:
      - "Look for python.exe, python3, or python2 process launches"
      - "Check command-line arguments for encoded, obfuscated, or file-based script execution"
      - "Check if Python was installed by default or dropped manually"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Context"
    checklist:
      - "Was the script executed from temp/downloads directory?"
      - "Review user privileges and process tree"
      - "Extract script if possible and perform static analysis"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Response Actions"
    checklist:
      - "Kill the Python process if suspicious"
      - "Search for lateral movement or persistence setup"
      - "Scan host and related IPs for artifacts"

triage_labels:
  - severity: High (if sourced externally or unknown scripts)
  - confidence: High

ioc_types:
  - Process Path
  - Command-line
  - Script Hash
