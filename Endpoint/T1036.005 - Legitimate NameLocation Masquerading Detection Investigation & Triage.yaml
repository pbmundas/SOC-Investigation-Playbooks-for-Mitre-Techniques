tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1036.005"
technique_name: "Masquerading: Legitimate Name/Location"
description: >
  Detect adversaries using legitimate file names or placing malicious files in legitimate locations to evade detection.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Files with Legitimate Names in Suspicious Locations"
    description: >
      Search for files with legitimate system or application names running or stored outside expected directories.
    checklist:
      - "Are files named after common system utilities located outside standard paths?"
      - "Are files with legitimate names exhibiting unusual behavior?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Process creation logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Verify File Integrity and Digital Signatures"
    description: >
      Validate the authenticity of files by checking digital signatures and comparing hashes to known good baselines.
    checklist:
      - "Is the file unsigned or signed by an unknown publisher?"
      - "Does the hash differ from the official binary?"
    data_sources:
      - "File hash databases"
      - "Digital signature verification logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Monitor Execution and Behavior of Masqueraded Files"
    description: >
      Observe if these files spawn suspicious child processes or perform unauthorized actions.
    checklist:
      - "Do masqueraded files initiate network connections?"
      - "Are there attempts to escalate privileges?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection and response (EDR)"
      - "Network traffic logs"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Mitigate"
    description: >
      Quarantine suspicious files and alert relevant teams for further analysis.
    checklist:
      - "Isolate or remove files that fail verification."
      - "Implement monitoring rules to detect reoccurrence."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "SIEM alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Files located in unusual locations but verified safe."
      - "Medium: Suspicious behavior without confirmed maliciousness."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious masquerading."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified threats."
      - "Medium: Indicators present but incomplete."
      - "Low: Likely false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "File names identical to legitimate system binaries"
  - "Files located outside normal directories"
  - "Unsigned or altered binaries"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect legitimate-named files in non-standard locations"
    query: >
      file.name:("svchost.exe" OR "explorer.exe") AND NOT file.path:"C:\\Windows\\System32"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on process executions from suspicious locations."
  - "Trigger automated file integrity checks."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if file location change was authorized."
  - "Correlate with threat intelligence feeds."
