tactic: "Credential Access"

technique_name: "Brute Force"
description: >
  Detect brute force or password guessing attempts targeting AWS IAM accounts or root console login,
  which could lead to account compromise and privilege escalation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Failed Login Attempts to AWS Console and IAM"
    description: >
      Track unsuccessful console login attempts and failed AWS API authentication events to identify brute force activity.
    checklist:
      - "Are there repeated failed login attempts from a single IP or user agent?"
      - "Is there a spike in failed AWS API authentication events?"
      - "Are attempts targeting high-privilege accounts or root?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail Logs"
      - "AWS CloudWatch"
      - "AWS GuardDuty"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Successful Logins Following Multiple Failures"
    description: >
      Detect successful login attempts immediately after a series of failures, indicating potential credential compromise.
    checklist:
      - "Is there a successful login after multiple failed attempts?"
      - "Is the login from an unusual IP, device, or geographic location?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "GuardDuty"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Occasional failed login attempts consistent with user error."
      - "Medium: Multiple failed attempts from unknown sources."
      - "High: Successful login after numerous failed attempts, especially on root or privileged accounts."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed brute force or password spraying activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed credential misuse."
      - "Low: Routine login failures."

ioc_types:
  - "Multiple failed login attempts from a single source"
  - "Successful login after failed attempts from unusual locations"
  - "Repeated failed AWS API authentication"

automation_hooks:
  - "Trigger alert on multiple failed login attempts."
  - "Lock or require MFA re-verification for targeted accounts."
  - "Notify security team for investigation on successful logins after failures."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review IP addresses and geolocation for suspicious access."
  - "Check if MFA was enforced and properly used."
  - "Audit account activity following successful login."
