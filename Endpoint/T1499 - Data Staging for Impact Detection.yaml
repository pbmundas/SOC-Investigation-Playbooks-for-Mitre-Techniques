playbook_name: "T1499 - Data Staging for Impact Detection"
tactic: "Impact"
technique_id: "T1499"
technique_name: "Data Staging for Impact"
description: >
  Detect adversaries preparing or staging data on systems in preparation for an impact event such as ransomware or data destruction.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Large Scale Data Aggregation"
    description: >
      Detect unusual data copying, archiving, or consolidation activities on endpoints or servers.
    checklist:
      - "Are there large data movements within local or network storage?"
      - "Are file archiving or compression utilities invoked frequently?"
      - "Is there unusual file access or modification timestamps?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system logs"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor for Use of Staging or Backup Locations"
    description: >
      Look for data being moved to locations often used for staging or backups prior to impact.
    checklist:
      - "Are there writes to removable media or alternate storage?"
      - "Is data copied to hidden or uncommon directories?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access logs"
      - "Removable media logs"
      - "Network share access logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Known Impact Indicators"
    description: >
      Check for indicators such as ransomware process activity or destructive commands following staging.
    checklist:
      - "Is there concurrent suspicious process execution?"
      - "Are encryption or deletion events detected soon after staging?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR alerts"
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Security event logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate data backup or staging."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or anomalous staging behavior."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious data staging for impact."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious staging correlated with impact."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Possible benign activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Unusual large file copy/move"
  - "Suspicious archive or compression usage"
  - "Access to staging or backup locations"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Large File Copy Operations"
    query: >
      file.operation IN (copy, move) AND
      file.size > threshold

  - name: "Detect Archive Utility Usage"
    query: >
      process.name IN (zip, rar, 7z, tar) AND
      process.start_time > recent_timeframe

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on large scale data staging."
  - "Isolate systems showing suspicious activity."
  - "Trigger immediate investigation and containment."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if data staging aligns with normal backups."
  - "Investigate involved files and user/process activity."
  - "Prepare for possible ransomware or destructive impact."
