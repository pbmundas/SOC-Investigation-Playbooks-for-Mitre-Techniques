playbook_name: "T1573 - Encrypted Channel Command and Control Detection"
tactic: "Command and Control"
technique_id: "T1573"
technique_name: "Encrypted Channel"
description: >
  Detect adversaries using encrypted channels (e.g., SSL/TLS, SSH) for command and control communication.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Encrypted Traffic Metadata"
    description: >
      Analyze encrypted traffic patterns, including unusual connection frequencies, durations, and destinations.
    checklist:
      - "Are there connections to suspicious or unrecognized IPs over SSL/TLS or SSH?"
      - "Is there unusually persistent or frequent encrypted traffic?"
      - "Are there anomalies in SSL certificate properties (e.g., self-signed, expired)?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network flow logs"
      - "TLS/SSL inspection logs"
      - "Firewall logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Inspect SSL/TLS Certificate Anomalies"
    description: >
      Identify certificates with unusual attributes, such as uncommon issuers or mismatched domains.
    checklist:
      - "Are there self-signed or invalid certificates?"
      - "Is certificate usage consistent with known legitimate services?"
    data_sources:
      - "SSL inspection tools"
      - "Certificate logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Encrypted Traffic with Endpoint Process Activity"
    description: >
      Link encrypted connections with suspicious processes or unusual endpoint behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Are processes initiating encrypted connections known or trusted?"
      - "Is there evidence of encrypted traffic related to malware or unauthorized apps?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "Process monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal encrypted traffic."
      - "Medium: Suspicious encrypted connections."
      - "High: Confirmed encrypted channel C2."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: IOC match or malicious payload detected."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Possibly legitimate encrypted communication."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious IPs or domains using encrypted protocols"
  - "Anomalous SSL certificates"
  - "Unusual encrypted connection metadata"

queries/examples:

      tls.connection_count > threshold

  - name: "Detect Unusual Persistent SSL Connections"
    query: >
      tls.connection_duration > threshold_seconds AND
