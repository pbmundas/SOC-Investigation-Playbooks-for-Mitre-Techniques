tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1547.006"
technique_name: "Launch Agent"
description: >
  Detect adversaries who install malicious launch agents to persist on macOS systems.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Launch Agent Locations"
    description: >
      Detect new or modified launch agents in standard macOS directories.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new or altered files in ~/Library/LaunchAgents or /Library/LaunchAgents?"
      - "Are launch agents signed and authorized?"
      - "Is the plist configured to load suspicious binaries or scripts?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"
      - "macOS system logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Launch Agent Executions"
    description: >
      Monitor process creation from launch agents.
    checklist:
      - "Are launch agent processes starting unexpected binaries?"
      - "Are child processes of launch agents unusual?"
      - "Is there network activity associated with launch agent processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Network monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with System Anomalies"
    description: >
      Check for suspicious user activity, escalations, or persistence.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected privilege escalations?"
      - "Are user sessions or login times anomalous?"
    data_sources:
      - "User activity logs"
      - "Security monitoring"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate Legitimate Use or Respond"
    description: >
      Confirm whether launch agents are authorized or malicious.
    checklist:
      - "Is the launch agent installed by IT or authorized software?"
      - "Is removal or quarantine required?"
    data_sources:
      - "Asset management"
      - "Incident response"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized launch agents."
      - "Medium: Unverified but non-critical launch agents."
      - "High: Malicious launch agents detected."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known malicious launch agent signature or behavior."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed."
      - "Low: Known benign agent."

ioc_types:
  - "Launch agent plist hashes"
  - "Process parent-child relationships"
  - "File creation/modification times"

queries/examples:
  - name: "New or Modified Launch Agents"
    query: >
      file.path:("/Users/*/Library/LaunchAgents/*" OR "/Library/LaunchAgents/*") AND
      event.action:("file_created" OR "file_modified")
  - name: "Launch Agent Process Executions"
    query: >
      process.parent.name:"launchd" AND
      process.command_line:("*suspicious_binary*")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on new or modified launch agents."
  - "Block execution of suspicious launch agent binaries."
  - "Quarantine malicious launch agents."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify launch agent source and signature."
  - "Correlate with user activity and other alerts."
  - "Use threat intel to validate known bad agents."
