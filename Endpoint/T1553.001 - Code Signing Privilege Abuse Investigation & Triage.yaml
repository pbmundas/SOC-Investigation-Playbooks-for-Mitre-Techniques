playbook_name: "T1553.001 - Code Signing Privilege Abuse: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1553.001"
technique_name: "Code Signing Privilege Abuse"
description: >
  Detect abuse of code signing privileges where adversaries sign malicious code to bypass security controls.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Code Signed Binaries with Suspicious Attributes"
    description: >
      Detect signed binaries with unusual signer details or invalid trust chains.
    checklist:
      - "Are binaries signed by unknown or suspicious entities?"
      - "Is the signing certificate valid and trusted?"
      - "Are signing timestamps or attributes inconsistent?"
    data_sources:
      - "Code signing logs"
      - "Certificate validation results"
      - "File metadata"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor for Unauthorized Use of Code Signing Keys"
    description: >
      Detect unauthorized signing activities or key compromise.
    checklist:
      - "Are code signing keys used outside normal business processes?"
      - "Are there anomalies in signing activity volume or timing?"
    data_sources:
      - "Key management logs"
      - "Certificate authority logs"
      - "Audit trails"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Execution of Signed Malware"
    description: >
      Detect execution of malicious binaries signed with legitimate or abused certificates.
    checklist:
      - "Are signed binaries exhibiting malicious behavior?"
      - "Are these binaries triggering other alerts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection"
      - "Malware sandbox analysis"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate or Revoke Certificates"
    description: >
      Verify legitimacy and take remediation actions if abuse is confirmed.
    checklist:
      - "Is certificate revocation or key rotation necessary?"
      - "Are incident response and PKI teams engaged?"
    data_sources:
      - "Certificate revocation lists"
      - "Incident response platforms"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized signing activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed abuse."
      - "High: Confirmed abuse of code signing privileges."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known compromised keys or malicious binaries."
      - "Medium: Unusual signing patterns."
      - "Low: Unverified anomalies."

ioc_types:
  - "Signing certificate details"
  - "Signed binary hashes"
  - "Key usage logs"
  - "Execution telemetry of signed files"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Binaries Signed by Unknown Entities"
    query: >
      file.code_signature.issuer:NOT("KnownTrustedCA") AND
      file.code_signature.status:"Valid"
  - name: "Unusual Code Signing Activity"
    query: >
      event.category:"code_signing" AND
      event.outcome:"success" AND
      event.timestamp:>=now-1d AND
      user.name:NOT_IN(authorized_signers)
  - name: "Execution of Signed Files Triggering Malware Alerts"
    query: >
      process.file_signature_status:"Signed" AND
      process.behavior:"malicious"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious code signing activity."
  - "Block execution of signed binaries failing reputation checks."
  - "Trigger key revocation and incident escalation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify signer identity and certificate chain."
  - "Coordinate with PKI and IR teams for key revocation."
  - "Update allowlists and blocklists accordingly."
