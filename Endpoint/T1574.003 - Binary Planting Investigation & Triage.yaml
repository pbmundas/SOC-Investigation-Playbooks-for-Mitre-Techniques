tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1574.003"
technique_name: "Binary Planting"
description: >
  Playbook to investigate binary planting where adversaries place malicious executables or binaries
  in locations searched by legitimate applications to achieve code execution or persistence.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Suspicious Binaries in Common Search Paths"
    description: >
      Identify executable files planted in directories commonly searched by legitimate applications.
    checklist:
      - "Are there binaries in writable or user directories?"
      - "Are the binaries unsigned or recently modified?"
      - "Do file hashes match known malware?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "File Integrity Monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Process and Execution Context"
    description: >
      Review processes executing planted binaries and their spawning chain.
    checklist:
      - "Are binaries launched by trusted applications unexpectedly?"
      - "Is there anomalous parent-child process relationship?"
      - "Are command lines or loaded modules suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs"
      - "Process trees"
      - "Command line auditing"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Investigate Persistence or Follow-on Actions"
    description: >
      Determine if planted binaries are used to maintain persistence or advance attacks.
    checklist:
      - "Are binaries linked to startup, scheduled tasks, or services?"
      - "Is there evidence of outbound communication or lateral movement?"
      - "Are related files or registry keys suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "Persistence mechanism logs"
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate User and System Activity"
    description: >
      Assess if binary planting is due to authorized activities or malicious intent.
    checklist:
      - "Are executables run by authorized users?"
      - "Are endpoint protections functioning?"
      - "Are patches applied for known application vulnerabilities?"
    data_sources:
      - "User login logs"
      - "Patch management"
      - "EDR alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known software installation or updates."
      - "Medium: Suspicious planted binaries with no immediate impact."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious binary planting and execution."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: IOC matches malware or attacker behavior."
      - "Medium: Anomalous binary placement or execution."
      - "Low: Expected system or user activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Executable file paths in writable or unusual directories"
  - "File hashes of suspicious binaries"
  - "Process execution chains"
  - "Persistence artifacts like scheduled tasks or services"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Executables in User or Temp Directories"
    query: >
      file.extension:"exe" AND file.path:("*\\Users\\*" OR "*\\Temp\\*") AND
      file.creation_time:>=now-7d
  - name: "Suspicious Process Launch from Untrusted Locations"
    query: >
      process.name:("unknown.exe") AND process.parent.name:("trustedApp.exe")
  - name: "Unsigned Executables Executed"
    query: >
      process.name:"*.exe" AND file.signed:false AND event.action:"process_start"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on executable creation in writable locations"
  - "Trigger automated hash lookup and sandbox execution"
  - "Block or quarantine suspicious executables"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify executables against known software baseline."
  - "Analyze parent-child process relationships."
  - "Engage patch management to fix application search order vulnerabilities."
  - "Coordinate with threat intel for malware identification."
