playbook_name: "T1119 - Use of Lambda or EC2 Scripts to Collect Data"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1119"
technique_name: "Automated Collection"
description: >
  Detect and investigate automated data collection activities using AWS Lambda functions or EC2 instance scripts.
  Attackers may leverage these to gather sensitive data from cloud resources, databases, or file systems for exfiltration or further exploitation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Lambda Functions or EC2 Scripts Accessing Sensitive Data"
    description: >
      Monitor Lambda executions and EC2 script activities that interact with sensitive AWS resources such as S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, or RDS databases.
    checklist:
      - "Are there Lambda functions accessing sensitive data outside normal business logic?"
      - "Are EC2 scripts performing unexpected data reads or exports?"
      - "Is there unusual timing or frequency of data access operations?"
    data_sources:
      - "Lambda Execution Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "EC2 System and Application Logs"
      - "S3 Access Logs"
      - "Database Access Logs (DynamoDB, RDS)"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Suspicious Data Collection Patterns"
    description: >
      Look for anomalous or bulk data collection behaviors such as large data transfers, repetitive queries, or access to sensitive information by unauthorized roles.
    checklist:
      - "Are data queries unusually large or frequent?"
      - "Are there bulk exports or transfers to unknown destinations?"
      - "Are unauthorized IAM roles or users performing data access?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "Network Flow Logs"
      - "AWS Config"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Data Collection Activities with Other Threat Indicators"
    description: >
      Cross-reference data collection events with other suspicious activities like privilege escalation or unusual login patterns.
    checklist:
      - "Is data collection preceded or followed by suspicious API calls or CLI executions?"
      - "Are credentials used for data access recently obtained or escalated?"
      - "Are multiple resources accessed in a short time frame?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "IAM Access Logs"
      - "Process Monitoring Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized data collection by known services or applications."
      - "Medium: Anomalous data collection requiring further investigation."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious automated data collection."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear evidence of unauthorized automated data collection."
      - "Medium: Suspicious behavior with contextual indicators."
      - "Low: Routine operations with slight deviations."

ioc_types:
  - "Lambda functions or EC2 scripts accessing large amounts of sensitive data"
  - "Unusual data queries or bulk data exports"
  - "Unauthorized IAM role or user access during data collection"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Lambda Accessing Sensitive Data"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventSource="lambda.amazonaws.com" AND eventName IN ("Invoke", "GetObject", "Scan", "Query")
  - name: "EC2 Scripts Performing Data Reads"
    query: >
      ec2_logs: process_name IN ("python", "bash", "sh") AND file_access IN ("/var/data", "/mnt/data", "/tmp") AND user NOT IN authorized_users
  - name: "Bulk Data Transfers from S3"
    query: >
      s3_access_logs: eventName="GetObject" AND bytesTransferred > 100000000

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on large or unusual data access by Lambda or EC2 scripts."
  - "Trigger IAM role and permission reviews for data access."
  - "Block or throttle suspicious bulk data transfers."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm legitimacy of automated data collection workflows."
  - "Correlate with other attack indicators such as credential misuse or privilege escalation."
  - "Recommend applying least privilege and monitoring on Lambda and EC2 access."
