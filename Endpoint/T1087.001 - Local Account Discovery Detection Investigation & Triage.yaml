playbook_name: "T1087.001 - Local Account Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1087.001"
technique_name: "Local Account Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries attempting to enumerate local accounts on machines to identify targets for further attack.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Commands and Tools Accessing Local Accounts"
    description: >
      Monitor for use of commands like `net user`, `wmic useraccount` or PowerShell cmdlets querying local user accounts.
    checklist:
      - "Is 'net user' executed on endpoints?"
      - "Are WMI queries or PowerShell commands targeting local users?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Unusual Local Account Enumeration Activity"
    description: >
      Look for local account queries from non-administrative users or unexpected hosts.
    checklist:
      - "Is local account enumeration performed by unknown or low-privileged users?"
      - "Are there multiple enumeration attempts in a short time frame?"
    data_sources:
      - "User session logs"
      - "Endpoint monitoring logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Endpoint Reconnaissance or Credential Access"
    description: >
      Investigate if local account discovery correlates with privilege escalation or credential dumping activity.
    checklist:
      - "Are there subsequent attempts to access credentials or escalate privileges?"
      - "Is local enumeration followed by suspicious process executions?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection and response logs"
      - "Credential access monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Local enumeration by authorized admin users."
      - "Medium: Enumeration by suspicious or unknown users."
      - "High: Enumeration linked to credential theft or lateral movement."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed local account enumeration without authorization."
      - "Medium: Unusual local account queries pending verification."
      - "Low: Administrative maintenance activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Use of net user or wmic commands on endpoints"
  - "PowerShell scripts enumerating local accounts"
  - "Process execution with local account query parameters"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect net user Command on Endpoint"
    query: >
      process.name == "cmd.exe" AND
      process.command_line CONTAINS "net user"

  - name: "Detect WMIC UserAccount Query"
    query: >
      process.name == "wmic.exe" AND
      process.command_line CONTAINS "useraccount"

automation_hooks:
  - "Generate alerts on local account enumeration commands."
  - "Restrict permissions for executing such commands."
  - "Isolate suspicious endpoint if malicious activity detected."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if enumeration commands are part of maintenance."
  - "Correlate with other suspicious activity on the endpoint."
  - "Suggest hardening endpoint security and limiting admin access."
