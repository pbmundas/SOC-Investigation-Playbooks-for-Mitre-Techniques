playbook_name: "T1110.003 - Credential Stuffing Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1110.003"
technique_name: "Credential Stuffing"
description: >
  Detects automated injection of stolen credentials (username/password pairs) from external breaches to gain unauthorized access.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Multiple Failed Logins Using Known Breached Credentials"
    description: >
      Detect authentication failures using username/password pairs sourced from breached databases.
    checklist:
      - "Are failed login attempts using credentials from known data breaches?"
      - "Are attempts coming from suspicious IP ranges or anonymizing services?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate Successful Logins with Breached Credential Use"
    description: >
      Identify any successful login following failed credential stuffing attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Is there a successful login from an IP or user involved in credential stuffing?"
      - "Is there suspicious activity post-login?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "User activity monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Detect High Volume Login Attempts and Unusual Patterns"
    description: >
      Monitor for high volumes of login attempts with diverse usernames from single or distributed IP addresses.
    checklist:
      - "Are there bursts of login attempts exceeding normal user behavior?"
      - "Is there use of VPNs, TOR, or proxy IPs?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Firewall logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Low volume and no successful login."
      - "Medium: Multiple failed attempts using breached credentials."
      - "High: Successful login from credential stuffing activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known breached credential sets."
      - "Medium: Suspicious pattern consistent with credential stuffing."
      - "Low: Isolated failed attempts."

ioc_types:
  - "Login attempts using breached username/password pairs"
  - "IP addresses associated with anonymizers"
  - "Successful access after credential stuffing attempts"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Credential Stuffing Attempts"
    query: >
      event.type == "authentication_failure" AND
      user.name IN (breached_user_list) AND
      count() BY source.ip WITHIN 10 minutes > 20

  - name: "Successful Login After Credential Stuffing"
    query: >
      event.type == "authentication_success" AND
      previous_events(event.type == "authentication_failure" AND user.name == current.user.name) > 5 WITHIN 30 minutes

automation_hooks:
  - "Block or throttle IPs exhibiting credential stuffing."
  - "Notify security teams and affected users."
  - "Force password reset and MFA enrollment on compromised accounts."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate breach credential lists regularly."
  - "Monitor for suspicious post-login activities."
  - "Implement and enforce robust authentication policies."
