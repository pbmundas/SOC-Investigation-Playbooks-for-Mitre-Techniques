playbook_name: "T1078.002 - Creation of New IAM Users or Roles for Persistence: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1078.002"
technique_name: "Valid Accounts - New IAM Users or Roles Creation"
description: >
  Detect and investigate the creation of new IAM users or roles that may be used by attackers to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Creation of IAM Users and Roles"
    description: >
      Review AWS CloudTrail for CreateUser and CreateRole events.
    checklist:
      - "Are new users or roles created outside of change management windows?"
      - "Are they created by unexpected principals?"
      - "Are naming conventions unusual or suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail (CreateUser, CreateRole)"
      - "AWS Config IAM history"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Assess Permissions of Newly Created Users or Roles"
    description: >
      Evaluate attached policies and permissions for potential overprivilege.
    checklist:
      - "Are administrator or highly privileged policies attached?"
      - "Are inline or managed policies suspicious or overly permissive?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail (PutUserPolicy, AttachUserPolicy, PutRolePolicy, AttachRolePolicy)"
      - "IAM Access Advisor"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Detect Usage of Newly Created Users or Roles"
    description: >
      Look for logins, API calls, or AssumeRole usage involving the new accounts.
    checklist:
      - "Are new accounts used soon after creation?"
      - "Is usage from unusual IPs or times?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail (ConsoleLogin, API calls, AssumeRole)"
      - "CloudWatch Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate user or role creation."
      - "Medium: Suspicious creation needing validation."
      - "High: Unauthorized creation with active suspicious use."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Direct evidence of unauthorized creation and misuse."
      - "Medium: Unusual creation activity."
      - "Low: Potential false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "CreateUser and CreateRole API events"
  - "New IAM user or role with admin privileges"
  - "Login or API usage by new IAM entities"
