investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Web Content Changes"
    description: >
      Detect unexpected or unauthorized changes to website files or application content.
    checklist:
      - "Are web files or pages modified outside normal maintenance windows?"
      - "Are unusual changes in file hashes or timestamps detected?"
      - "Are unauthorized users or processes accessing web directories?"
    data_sources:
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "Web server logs"
      - "Version control systems"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Defacement Indicators"
    description: >
      Look for known defacement patterns such as altered index.html or injected scripts.
    checklist:
      - "Are defacement message files or graffiti found?"
      - "Are malicious scripts or redirects injected?"
    data_sources:
      - "Web content monitoring tools"
      - "Intrusion detection systems"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Access Logs"
    description: >
      Check for suspicious login or file modification activity prior to defacement.
    checklist:
      - "Are privileged accounts compromised?"
      - "Is there evidence of lateral movement?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "EDR telemetry"

      - "Medium: Suspicious content changes."
      - "High: Confirmed defacement."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified defacement events."
      - "Medium: Suspicious anomalies."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Modified web files"
