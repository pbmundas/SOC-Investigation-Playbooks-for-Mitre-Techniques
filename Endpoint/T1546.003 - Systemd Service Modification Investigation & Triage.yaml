technique_name: "Systemd Service Modification"
description: >
  Playbook to investigate suspicious or malicious modifications to systemd service files on Linux systems,
  which adversaries use to maintain persistence or execute code during system startup.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Modified or New Systemd Service Files"
    description: >
      Identify recent changes or new files in systemd service directories.
    checklist:
      - "Which service files were added or modified (/etc/systemd/system/, /lib/systemd/system/)?"
      - "When were these files modified or created?"
      - "Are these services enabled to start on boot?"
    data_sources:
      - "File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)"
      - "Linux audit logs"
      - "Systemd status and configuration"
      - "EDR file monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Service File Content"
    description: >
      Review the contents of the service files for malicious or suspicious commands.
    checklist:
      - "Do service files execute suspicious binaries or scripts?"
      - "Are there references to network connections, reverse shells, or encoded commands?"
      - "Is there evidence of attempts to escalate privileges?"
    data_sources:
      - "Service file contents"
      - "Threat intelligence"
      - "Static/dynamic malware analysis"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with System and Network Activity"
    description: >
      Link service modifications with process executions and network events.
    checklist:
      - "Did any suspicious processes start from the modified service?"
      - "Are there unusual network connections following service start?"
      - "Any related user or privilege escalation events?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs"
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "User and privilege escalation logs"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate User and Execution Context"
    description: >
      Check if changes were made by authorized users and conform with normal system behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Who modified the service files?"
      - "Is the modification consistent with admin activity?"
      - "Are there signs of lateral movement or suspicious logins?"
    data_sources:
      - "User login/session logs"
      - "Audit logs"
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate admin/system updates."
      - "Medium: Unusual modification but no malicious activity detected."
      - "High: Malicious or unauthorized service modifications detected."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known malicious indicators or matches threat intel."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but requires more analysis."
      - "Low: Routine system maintenance."

ioc_types:
  - "Modified systemd service file paths"
  - "Service binary or script hashes"
  - "User accounts modifying services"
  - "Network connections triggered by service"
  - "Process trees linked to service start"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Modified Systemd Service Files"
    query: >
      file.path:(/etc/systemd/system/*.service OR /lib/systemd/system/*.service) AND
      file.event_type:"modify" AND
      file.modification_time:>=now-1d
  - name: "Detect New Systemd Service Enabled"
    query: >
      systemd.status:"enabled" AND
      file.creation_time:>=now-7d AND
      file.path:(/etc/systemd/system/*.service OR /lib/systemd/system/*.service)
  - name: "Suspicious Systemd Service Process Launch"
    query: >
      process.parent.name:"systemd" AND
      process.name:(bash OR sh OR python OR perl OR suspicious_binary)

automation_hooks:
  - "Auto-hash and sandbox any new/modified service binaries or scripts"
  - "Alert on service changes by non-admin users"
  - "Trigger endpoint isolation on confirmed malicious service modifications"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Check systemd services for unusual commands or network activity."
  - "Correlate file changes with user and process logs."
  - "Use threat intelligence to identify known bad payloads."
  - "Document findings and escalate if confirmed malicious."
