description: >
  Detect adversaries using mail protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP) for command and control communication.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Mail Protocol Traffic for Anomalies"
    description: >
      Analyze SMTP, POP3, and IMAP traffic for unusual patterns, such as spikes in volume, unusual destinations, or irregular commands.
    checklist:
      - "Are there connections to unknown or suspicious mail servers?"
      - "Is there abnormal volume or frequency of mail traffic?"
      - "Are there atypical SMTP commands or large attachments?"
    data_sources:
      - "Mail server logs"
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "Firewall and proxy logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Known Malicious Mail Server Indicators"
    description: >
      Match mail server IPs and domains against threat intelligence feeds.
    checklist:
      - "Are connections made to known malicious mail servers?"
      - "Are there suspicious domain lookups related to mail traffic?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence"
      - "DNS logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Identify Encoded or Obfuscated Payloads in Mail Traffic"
    description: >
      Detect base64 or other encoded data in mail body or attachments indicating C2 payloads.
    checklist:
      - "Are emails containing unusual attachments or encoded content?"
      - "Is there evidence of automated or scripted mail sending?"
    data_sources:
      - "Mail content inspection tools"
      - "Antivirus/Antimalware logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal mail traffic."
      - "Medium: Suspicious mail traffic with anomalies."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious mail-based C2 activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed IOC match or malicious payload."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies without IOC confirmation."
      - "Low: Possible false positives due to legitimate mail activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Malicious mail server IPs/domains"
  - "Encoded or obfuscated mail payloads"
  - "Unusual mail protocol commands or volumes"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect SMTP Traffic to Suspicious Mail Servers"
    query: >
      smtp.destination_ip IN (malicious_ip_list) OR
      smtp.rcpt_to_domain IN (malicious_domain_list)

  - name: "Detect Base64 Encoded Email Attachments"
    query: >
      mail.attachment_content_type = "application/octet-stream" AND
      mail.body_content MATCHES "base64"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious mail protocol usage."
  - "Block outgoing connections to known malicious mail servers."
  - "Trigger investigation workflows for suspicious mail traffic."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review mail sender and recipient details."
  - "Correlate with endpoint detections of malware or suspicious processes."
  - "Check for lateral movement or data exfiltration via mail."
