tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1003.003"
technique_name: "NTDS.dit"
description: >
  Detect attempts to dump credentials from the NTDS.dit database used by Active Directory Domain Controllers to store user account information and password hashes.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Access or Dumping of NTDS.dit File"
    description: >
      Monitor for file access or copying of NTDS.dit and related registry files on Domain Controllers.
    checklist:
      - "Are processes accessing or copying NTDS.dit or SYSTEM registry hives?"
      - "Is there evidence of tools dumping NTDS content?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access logs"
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Windows Event Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Use of Credential Dumping Tools Targeting NTDS"
    description: >
      Detect execution of tools like ntdsutil, Mimikatz, or other utilities targeting AD database.
    checklist:
      - "Are known AD credential dumping tools executed?"
      - "Is volume shadow copy used to access NTDS?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Abnormal Domain Controller Activity"
    description: >
      Look for unusual authentication patterns or lateral movement from Domain Controllers.
    checklist:
      - "Are there suspicious logins or replication events?"
      - "Is there lateral movement involving Domain Controllers?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate backup or admin activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious NTDS access without confirmed dump."
      - "High: Confirmed NTDS credential dumping."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known tool execution and dump creation."
      - "Medium: Suspicious file access on DC."
      - "Low: Possible benign activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to NTDS.dit or SYSTEM registry files"
  - "Execution of domain credential dumping tools"
  - "Volume shadow copy usage on DCs"
