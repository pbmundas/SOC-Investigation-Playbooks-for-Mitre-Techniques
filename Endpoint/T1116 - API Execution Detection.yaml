playbook_name: "API Execution Detection"
tactic: "Execution"
technique_id: "T1116"
technique_name: "Execution through API"
description: >
  Detects the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) for executing payloads or tasks, often to bypass command-line or script-based detections.

detection_sources:
  - EDR (API hook monitoring)
  - Windows ETW traces (native API)
  - Sysmon Event ID 10 (ProcessAccess)
  - In-memory scanning logs

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify API Execution Context"
    checklist:
      - "Check for common malicious API calls (e.g., CreateRemoteThread, VirtualAllocEx)"
      - "Review modules loaded by the process (DLLs)"
      - "Analyze process ancestry to identify execution origin"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate With Known Techniques"
    checklist:
      - "Was the API call used in process injection or evasion?"
      - "Check for reflective code loading, PE injection"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Contain and Confirm"
    checklist:
      - "Capture memory for forensic analysis"
      - "Review process network connections"
      - "Mark IOCs and scan for lateral movement"

triage_labels:
  - severity: High
  - confidence: Mediumâ€“High

ioc_types:
  - API call patterns
  - Parent/child process
  - Loaded DLLs
