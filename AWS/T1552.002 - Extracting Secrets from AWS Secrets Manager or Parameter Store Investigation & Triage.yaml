tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1552.002"
technique_name: "Extracting Secrets from AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store"
description: >
  Detect activities indicating extraction or exfiltration of secrets from AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect API Calls Indicating Secret Extraction"
    description: >
      Monitor for GetSecretValue, GetParameters, and other secrets retrieval API calls.
    checklist:
      - "Are there repeated calls to extract secrets over a short time?"
      - "Are secrets being accessed from unusual IPs or by unauthorized identities?"
      - "Is there evidence of secrets being downloaded or exported?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail logs"
      - "AWS Config"
      - "Network monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Use of Extracted Secrets"
    description: >
      Check for suspicious use of extracted secrets such as new API calls, resource creation, or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Are secrets being used to assume roles or escalate privileges?"
      - "Is there unexpected creation of resources or API calls?"
      - "Is there lateral movement across accounts or regions?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "IAM logs"
      - "Network logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Anomalous Behavior"
    description: >
      Look for signs of attacker persistence or data exfiltration after secret extraction.
    checklist:
      - "Are logs or monitoring services being disabled?"
      - "Is there data download or network traffic spikes?"
      - "Are new IAM roles or users created shortly after?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "Network monitoring"
      - "AWS Config"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized secrets retrieval."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or high-frequency secret extraction."
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized secrets extraction and misuse."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Extraction followed by suspicious activity."
      - "Medium: Anomalous access without clear misuse."
      - "Low: Routine automation or backup operations."

ioc_types:
  - "Repeated GetSecretValue or GetParameters API calls"
  - "Unusual IP addresses accessing secrets"
  - "Subsequent use of extracted credentials for privilege escalation"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect High-Frequency Secrets Access"
    query: >
      eventName IN ("GetSecretValue","GetParameters") | stats count() by userIdentity.userName | where count > 10
  - name: "Detect Secrets Access from Unusual IPs"
    query: >
      eventName IN ("GetSecretValue","GetParameters") AND sourceIPAddress NOT IN (trusted IPs)

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious volume or pattern of secrets extraction."
  - "Automatically rotate secrets if compromise suspected."
  - "Trigger incident response and forensic investigation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate access with service owners or admins."
  - "Monitor for follow-on suspicious API usage or resource creation."
  - "Contain and remediate compromised credentials quickly."
