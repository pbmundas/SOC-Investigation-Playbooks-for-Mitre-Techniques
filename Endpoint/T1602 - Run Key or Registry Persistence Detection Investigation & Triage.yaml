playbook_name: "T1602 - Run Key or Registry Persistence Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1602"
technique_name: "Data from Configuration Repository"
description: >
  Detect persistence through registry modification in Windows Run keys or similar locations.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Registry Key Modification"
    description: >
      Look for suspicious modifications to autorun keys in the registry.
    checklist:
      - "Was a new Run/RunOnce key created or modified?"
      - "Was the value pointing to an unusual or unknown executable?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Registry"
      - "EDR registry event logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate with Process Execution"
    description: >
      Validate that the path in the registry was executed.
    checklist:
      - "Is the referenced binary executed upon login or startup?"
      - "Is it a known legitimate application or potentially malicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Startup execution logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Validate or Contain"
    description: >
      Confirm persistence mechanism and respond.
    checklist:
      - "Should the executable be removed or quarantined?"
      - "Should registry changes be reverted?"
    data_sources:
      - "IR tools"
      - "EDR platform"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Benign or system-related autoruns."
      - "Medium: Suspicious binary added to autorun."
      - "High: Known malware in autorun registry."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Hash matches known IOC."
      - "Medium: Unknown binary with suspicious path."
      - "Low: Registry key change with no execution."

ioc_types:
  - "Registry paths (Run/RunOnce)"
  - "Suspicious file paths"
  - "Hash of autorun binaries"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Registry Key Monitoring"
    query: >
      registry.path:("HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run" OR
                    "HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run") AND
      registry.action:"create" OR registry.action:"modify"

  - name: "Autorun Execution Validation"
    query: >
      process.executable_path:FROM(registry.autorun.value) AND
      NOT process.executable_path:IN(known_legit)

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on new Run key values."
  - "Flag unknown binaries set to auto-start."
  - "Trigger registry rollback or remediation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Inspect registry and binary details."
  - "Correlate execution times with user activity."
  - "Use sandbox or static analysis on unknown binaries."
