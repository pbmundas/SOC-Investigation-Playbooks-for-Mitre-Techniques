playbook_name: "T1497 - Sandbox Evasion Detection"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1497"
technique_name: "Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion"
description: >
  Detect adversaries attempting to evade detection by identifying and avoiding sandbox or virtualized environments.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Anti-Virtualization API Calls"
    description: >
      Monitor process behavior for checks against virtualization artifacts.
    checklist:
      - "Are APIs like `cpuid`, `GetTickCount`, `SystemManufacturer` used?"
      - "Is there querying of registry keys like `HKLM\\HARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System`?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR process logs"
      - "Sysmon (Event ID 1, 10, 13)"
      - "Security product telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Artifacts of Environmental Checks"
    description: >
      Look for indicators that malware is checking for known sandbox artifacts.
    checklist:
      - "Are common VM drivers or MAC addresses being scanned?"
      - "Is system uptime being queried unusually early?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process command-line logs"
      - "Registry access logs"
      - "File and DLL access traces"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Delayed or Conditional Execution"
    description: >
      Some malware delays execution or behaves differently depending on results.
    checklist:
      - "Are there long sleep or idle calls (e.g., >30s)?"
      - "Is execution gated behind conditional logic?"
    data_sources:
      - "Behavioral sandbox output"
      - "Memory dumps"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Medium: Suspected evasion behavior."
      - "High: Confirmed use of sandbox detection."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Evasion logic confirmed in code."
      - "Medium: Behavioral indicators present."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to virtualization-related registry keys"
  - "Delays before execution"
  - "Presence of sandbox string checks"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Query for Sleep Calls >30s"
    query: >
      process.name:* AND command_line:("sleep" OR "timeout") AND arguments:(">30")

  - name: "VM Environment Check via Registry"
    query: >
      registry.path:"*HARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System*" AND process.name:("powershell.exe" OR "reg.exe")

automation_hooks:
  - "Tag process as suspicious in EDR"
  - "Submit sample to deeper sandbox"
  - "Alert threat hunting team"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review full process tree and cross-check with sandbox reports."
  - "Flag binaries showing conditional evasion for reverse engineering."
  - "Correlate with other TTPs (e.g., T1055, T1203) for deeper analysis."
