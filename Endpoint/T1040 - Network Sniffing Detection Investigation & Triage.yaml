playbook_name: "T1040 - Network Sniffing Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1040"
technique_name: "Network Sniffing"
description: >
  Detects attempts by adversaries to capture network traffic to steal credentials, session tokens, or other sensitive data by using packet capture tools or network sniffing utilities.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Execution of Known Network Sniffing Tools"
    description: >
      Identify process executions of tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, tshark, or custom sniffing utilities.
    checklist:
      - "Are known sniffing tool processes running on endpoints?"
      - "Are these processes executed by authorized personnel or suspicious accounts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor Network Interface Modes"
    description: >
      Detect changes of network interfaces into promiscuous mode indicative of sniffing.
    checklist:
      - "Has any interface been switched to promiscuous mode unexpectedly?"
      - "Are these changes correlated with suspicious user activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network interface configuration logs"
      - "System audit logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Analyze Network Traffic for Unusual Packet Captures"
    description: >
      Review network traffic patterns for signs of sniffing or unauthorized capture attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Is there unusual volume or type of traffic from sniffing hosts?"
      - "Are there network captures being stored or transmitted to external locations?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network flow logs"
      - "Data loss prevention (DLP) systems"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized sniffing in controlled environments."
      - "Medium: Sniffing attempts in non-sensitive networks."
      - "High: Unauthorized sniffing in sensitive or production networks."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed sniffing tool execution or interface promiscuous mode."
      - "Medium: Suspicious network traffic patterns consistent with sniffing."
      - "Low: Ambiguous or benign network monitoring."

ioc_types:
  - "Process executions of tcpdump, wireshark, tshark"
  - "Network interface promiscuous mode enablement"
  - "Unusual network capture or export activity"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Tcpdump Process Execution"
    query: >
      process.name == "tcpdump" OR
      process.command_line CONTAINS "tcpdump"

  - name: "Detect Promiscuous Mode Enablement"
    query: >
      network.interface.status_changes CONTAINS "promiscuous"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized network sniffing tool execution."
  - "Block suspicious process executions if possible."
  - "Notify security team on promiscuous mode changes."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if sniffing tools are authorized for troubleshooting."
  - "Assess if sniffing is targeting sensitive network segments."
  - "Recommend restricting sniffing tool usage and monitoring network interfaces."
