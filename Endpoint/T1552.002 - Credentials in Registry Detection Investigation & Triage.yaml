playbook_name: "T1552.002 - Credentials in Registry Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1552.002"
technique_name: "Credentials in Registry"
description: >
  Detects credentials stored in Windows Registry locations often targeted by adversaries for credential harvesting.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to Registry Keys Storing Credentials"
    description: >
      Identify read or modification actions on registry paths commonly storing credentials (e.g., autologon, VNC, Remote Desktop).
    checklist:
      - "Are sensitive registry keys accessed or modified?"
      - "Which user or process accessed the key?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Registry event logs (Event ID 4657)"
      - "Process creation logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Registry Access in Context"
    description: >
      Correlate registry access with process ancestry and timing to identify suspicious behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Is the access tied to non-standard or unknown processes?"
      - "Is the timing aligned with privilege escalation or lateral movement activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR telemetry"
      - "Sysmon Event ID 13 (Registry Value Set), 12 (Registry Object Access)"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Look for Credential Extraction Behavior"
    description: >
      Detect if accessed registry data was exfiltrated or used in authentication attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Is there credential usage after access?"
      - "Any outbound connections to suspicious IPs?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Authentication logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Access to registry keys by legitimate process (e.g., explorer.exe)."
      - "Medium: Unusual access to sensitive keys by system scripts."
      - "High: Access by malware or script prior to lateral movement."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Credential strings extracted from registry access."
      - "Medium: Unusual registry access with suspicious context."
      - "Low: Legitimate tool accessing credential-related key."

ioc_types:
  - "HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon"
  - "HKCU\\Software\\SimonTatham\\PuTTY\\Sessions"
  - "HKCU\\Software\\ORL\\WinVNC3\\Password"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Access to Autologon Registry Keys"
    query: >
      registry.key_path IN ("HKLM\\...\\Winlogon\\DefaultPassword", "HKLM\\...\\Winlogon\\AutoAdminLogon") AND
      process.name NOT IN ("explorer.exe", "winlogon.exe")

  - name: "Sysmon Registry Access to VNC Credentials"
    query: >
      event_id:13 AND registry.key_path CONTAINS ("\\Software\\ORL\\WinVNC3\\Password")

automation_hooks:
  - "Generate alert for access to known credential registry keys."
  - "Create snapshot of registry values."
  - "Trigger hash reputation check of accessing process."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if the registry key contains plaintext or obfuscated credentials."
  - "Trace parent process chain for suspicious behavior."
  - "Recommend secure storage or removal of plaintext credentials."
