playbook_name: "T1213 - Access to S3 Buckets, DynamoDB, RDS Databases"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1213"
technique_name: "Data from Information Repositories"
description: >
  Detect and investigate unauthorized or suspicious access to AWS information repositories such as
  S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, and RDS databases. Attackers often target these repositories to collect
  sensitive data for exfiltration or further exploitation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to S3 Buckets"
    description: >
      Analyze S3 bucket access logs and CloudTrail events for unusual or unauthorized GetObject, ListBucket,
      or PutObject actions.
    checklist:
      - "Are there requests from unexpected IP addresses or regions?"
      - "Are there excessive or bulk data downloads?"
      - "Is access granted to users or roles with overly broad permissions?"
    data_sources:
      - "S3 Access Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "AWS Config"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Suspicious Access to DynamoDB Tables"
    description: >
      Review DynamoDB access patterns, focusing on Scan, Query, and BatchGetItem operations that may indicate
      bulk data retrieval.
    checklist:
      - "Are there frequent or large scans across tables?"
      - "Are queries issued from unauthorized or unusual identities?"
      - "Is there an abnormal increase in DynamoDB read capacity usage?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "DynamoDB Metrics and Logs"
      - "AWS CloudWatch"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Investigate RDS Database Access"
    description: >
      Examine RDS logs and CloudTrail events for suspicious connection attempts, data exports,
      or unusual query patterns.
    checklist:
      - "Are there logins from unknown IP addresses or unusual times?"
      - "Are there queries accessing sensitive tables or large data dumps?"
      - "Is there evidence of privilege escalation in database users?"
    data_sources:
      - "RDS Logs (Audit, General, Slow Query)"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "VPC Flow Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized access with proper monitoring."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access patterns requiring investigation."
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized or malicious data access."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear evidence of unauthorized data retrieval."
      - "Medium: Anomalous access with contextual concerns."
      - "Low: Routine operations with slight anomalies."

ioc_types:
  - "Unusual S3 GetObject or ListBucket requests"
  - "Bulk scans or queries on DynamoDB tables"
  - "Suspicious RDS connection attempts or data exports"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Suspicious S3 Bucket Access"
    query: >
      s3_access_logs: eventName IN ("GetObject", "ListBucket") AND sourceIPAddress NOT IN trusted_ips
  - name: "DynamoDB Large Scan Activity"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventSource="dynamodb.amazonaws.com" AND eventName="Scan" AND requestParameters.limit > 1000
  - name: "RDS Unusual Login or Query Patterns"
    query: >
      rds_logs: login_failure_count > 5 OR query_duration > 1000ms

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on excessive or unusual access to S3 buckets, DynamoDB, or RDS."
  - "Trigger IAM policy review for identities accessing sensitive repositories."
  - "Initiate network block or session termination for suspicious RDS connections."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate access requests against business needs and user roles."
  - "Correlate with other suspicious activities such as data exfiltration or privilege escalation."
  - "Recommend implementing encryption, logging, and least privilege policies."
