playbook_name: "T1548 - Elevation Control Abuse: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Privilege Escalation"
technique_id: "T1548"
technique_name: "Elevation Control Abuse"
description: >
  Detect abuse of elevation control mechanisms such as bypassing User Account Control (UAC) to escalate privileges.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect UAC Bypass Attempts"
    description: >
      Identify attempts to bypass or suppress UAC prompts to gain elevated privileges without user consent.
    checklist:
      - "Are there processes launched with elevated privileges without UAC prompts?"
      - "Is there evidence of known UAC bypass techniques in process execution?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Security Event Logs"
      - "Process creation and parent-child relationships"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor Use of Trusted Binaries for Elevation"
    description: >
      Detect use of signed system binaries (e.g., fodhelper.exe, eventvwr.exe) known to facilitate privilege escalation.
    checklist:
      - "Are these binaries executed unusually or with suspicious parameters?"
      - "Are elevated processes spawned from these binaries?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Command line auditing"
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement"
    description: >
      Link elevation abuse with attempts at persistence, lateral movement, or execution of payloads.
    checklist:
      - "Are elevated privileges followed by creation of new services or scheduled tasks?"
      - "Is lateral movement activity detected after elevation?"
    data_sources:
      - "Service creation logs"
      - "Scheduled task logs"
      - "Network connection logs"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate or Respond"
    description: >
      Confirm elevation abuse and respond accordingly.
    checklist:
      - "Is the affected account or system quarantined?"
      - "Are UAC and security policies reviewed and enforced?"
    data_sources:
      - "Incident response records"
      - "Endpoint configuration management"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Suspicious but unconfirmed elevation events."
      - "Medium: Potential UAC bypass attempts detected."
      - "High: Confirmed elevation control abuse."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known bypass signatures or tools detected."
      - "Medium: Anomalous elevation requests."
      - "Low: False positives or benign elevation."

ioc_types:
  - "Process names of known bypass binaries"
  - "Suspicious command line arguments"
  - "Parent-child process relationship anomalies"
  - "Event IDs related to privilege elevation"

queries/examples:
  - name: "UAC Bypass Execution via fodhelper.exe"
    query: >
      process.name:"fodhelper.exe" AND process.parent.name:"explorer.exe"
  - name: "Suspicious Event Viewer (eventvwr.exe) Execution"
    query: >
      process.name:"eventvwr.exe" AND process.command_line:"*reg*"
  - name: "Processes Launched with Elevated Privileges Without UAC"
    query: >
      event.id: (ProcessCreationEventIDs) AND
      process.integrity_level:"high" AND
      NOT event.related.uac_prompt

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on execution of known elevation abuse binaries."
  - "Block suspicious elevation attempts via application control."
  - "Trigger user session lockdown and forensic capture."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review process trees and command lines carefully."
  - "Validate elevation events against normal user behavior."
  - "Coordinate with endpoint security and policy enforcement teams."
