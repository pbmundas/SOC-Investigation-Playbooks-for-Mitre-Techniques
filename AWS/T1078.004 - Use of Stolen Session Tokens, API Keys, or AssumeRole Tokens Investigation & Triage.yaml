playbook_name: "T1078.004 - Use of Stolen Session Tokens, API Keys, or AssumeRole Tokens: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1078.004"
technique_name: "Use of Stolen Session Tokens, API Keys, or AssumeRole Tokens"
description: >
  Detect use of compromised or stolen AWS session tokens, API keys, or AssumeRole tokens, which attackers use to gain unauthorized access and persist within AWS environments.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Use of Suspicious or Unrecognized Credentials"
    description: >
      Monitor CloudTrail and logs for API calls using unusual or new access keys, session tokens, or assumed roles.
    checklist:
      - "Are API calls made using keys or tokens not associated with known users?"
      - "Is there use of temporary credentials via AssumeRole with suspicious timing?"
      - "Are there multiple sessions from different geographic locations or IPs?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "AWS IAM Access Analyzer"
      - "Network logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate with Anomalous Behavior or Resource Usage"
    description: >
      Review activity patterns following use of these credentials.
    checklist:
      - "Is there privilege escalation or unusual resource creation?"
      - "Are logs or monitoring configurations altered?"
      - "Is there data exfiltration or lateral movement?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "AWS Config"
      - "SIEM logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Investigate Credential Origin and Access Context"
    description: >
      Trace back to determine how the credentials were obtained or stolen.
    checklist:
      - "Are these credentials linked to previous breaches or leaked secrets?"
      - "Is there evidence of credential dumping or extraction?"
      - "Are IAM policies or roles overly permissive?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "AWS Config"
      - "Threat intelligence sources"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized temporary credential usage."
      - "Medium: Unusual or unexpected credential use."
      - "High: Confirmed use of stolen or compromised credentials."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Credential usage from known malicious IP or tied to breach."
      - "Medium: Suspicious usage pattern without full proof."
      - "Low: False positives due to automation or multi-region usage."

ioc_types:
  - "API calls using unknown or anomalous AccessKeyId or SessionToken"
  - "AssumeRole API calls from suspicious IPs"
  - "Use of temporary credentials inconsistent with normal behavior"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect AssumeRole Usage from Suspicious IPs"
    query: >
      eventName="AssumeRole" AND sourceIPAddress NOT IN (trusted IPs)
  - name: "Detect API Calls with Unknown Access Keys"
    query: >
      NOT userIdentity.accessKeyId IN (known valid keys)

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious AssumeRole or API key usage."
  - "Revoke suspected compromised tokens immediately."
  - "Trigger comprehensive incident response."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate credential usage with security and IAM teams."
  - "Rotate affected credentials immediately."
  - "Audit IAM roles and policies for least privilege enforcement."
