playbook_name: "T1560 - Archive Collected Data Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1560"
technique_name: "Archive Collected Data"
description: >
  Detects adversaries compressing or archiving collected data to reduce size and evade detection during exfiltration.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Creation of Archive Files"
    description: >
      Identify creation of compressed archive files such as .zip, .rar, .7z, or .tar.
    checklist:
      - "Are new archive files created in unusual locations or by suspicious processes?"
      - "Is archive creation activity correlated with data access or staging?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Process creation logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor Compression Tools Usage"
    description: >
      Detect execution of known compression or archiving utilities.
    checklist:
      - "Are tools like zip, 7zip, rar, or tar being executed unexpectedly?"
      - "Are these executions by non-standard users or at unusual times?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Archive Creation with Exfiltration Attempts"
    description: >
      Check if archive files are transferred out of the environment soon after creation.
    checklist:
      - "Is network transfer or upload activity detected immediately after archiving?"
      - "Are destinations suspicious or unknown?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "SIEM alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Archive creation as part of normal backup or maintenance."
      - "Medium: Suspicious archive creation without clear exfiltration."
      - "High: Unauthorized archiving linked to data exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious archiving followed by data transfer."
      - "Medium: Suspicious archiving activity."
      - "Low: Normal archive creation."

ioc_types:
  - "Creation of archive files in unusual locations"
  - "Execution of compression tools by unusual users"
  - "Archive files transferred to external hosts"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Archive File Creation"
    query: >
      file.extension IN (".zip", ".rar", ".7z", ".tar") AND
      file.creation_time > now() - 1h AND
      file.path NOT IN ("/backup/", "/logs/")

  - name: "Compression Tool Execution"
    query: >
      process.name IN ("zip.exe", "7z.exe", "rar.exe", "tar") AND
      user.name NOT IN ("backup", "admin")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on archive creation in suspicious contexts."
  - "Restrict use of compression tools by unauthorized users."
  - "Notify incident response on suspicious archiving activity."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if archiving is authorized."
  - "Investigate related file access and network activity."
  - "Check for signs of exfiltration following archiving."
