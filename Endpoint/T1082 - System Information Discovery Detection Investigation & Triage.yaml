playbook_name: "T1082 - System Information Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1082"
technique_name: "System Information Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries gathering detailed system information such as OS details, hardware configuration, and system environment to aid further exploitation or reconnaissance.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor System Information Gathering Commands"
    description: >
      Identify commands and tools used to gather system info (e.g., systeminfo, hostname, uname).
    checklist:
      - "Are commands like systeminfo, hostname, uname, or wmic being executed?"
      - "Are there PowerShell commands querying system properties?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Suspicious or Repeated System Information Queries"
    description: >
      Look for system info queries from unusual users or multiple attempts in a short timeframe.
    checklist:
      - "Is system info gathering performed outside of normal maintenance windows?"
      - "Are multiple hosts involved in system info queries?"
    data_sources:
      - "User activity logs"
      - "Endpoint monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Reconnaissance or Lateral Movement Activities"
    description: >
      Determine if system discovery correlates with other suspicious behavior such as lateral movement or exploitation attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Is system info gathering followed by privilege escalation or lateral movement?"
      - "Are there related network scans or credential access?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: System info commands executed by authorized admins."
      - "Medium: Multiple queries from suspicious accounts."
      - "High: System info discovery linked to active intrusions."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized system info queries."
      - "Medium: Suspicious commands without full context."
      - "Low: Routine system administration."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of systeminfo, hostname, uname, or wmic commands"
  - "PowerShell system property queries"
  - "Process creation with system discovery keywords"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect systeminfo Command Usage"
    query: >
      process.name == "systeminfo.exe"

  - name: "Detect PowerShell System Queries"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-WmiObject|Get-CimInstance"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious system discovery commands."
  - "Limit access to system info gathering tools."
  - "Investigate hosts generating multiple queries."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm legitimacy of system info queries."
  - "Correlate with other suspicious activity for context."
  - "Recommend endpoint hardening and monitoring."
