playbook_name: "T1218.005 - Userinit Execution Monitoring: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1218.005"
technique_name: "Userinit Execution Monitoring"
description: >
  Detect malicious or unauthorized executions of userinit.exe, often used to maintain persistence or execute payloads during user logon.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Userinit Execution"
    description: >
      Detect process creation of userinit.exe and analyze context, command line, and parent process.
    checklist:
      - "Is userinit.exe invoked during legitimate logon?"
      - "Are command line parameters suspicious or unusual?"
      - "Is userinit.exe spawned by abnormal parent processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Logon event monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Execution Context"
    description: >
      Confirm that userinit.exe is launched only during proper user login and not from unauthorized sources.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected userinit executions outside login?"
      - "Is persistence via registry or other means detected?"
    data_sources:
      - "Registry monitoring"
      - "File integrity monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Persistence and Malicious Activity"
    description: >
      Look for concurrent suspicious activity such as modified registry keys, scripts, or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Are registry Run keys or policies altered?"
      - "Is userinit.exe used to load malicious payloads?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM correlation"
      - "Threat intelligence"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Respond and Contain"
    description: >
      Block unauthorized userinit.exe executions and remediate persistence mechanisms.
    checklist:
      - "Revert unauthorized registry changes."
      - "Isolate affected endpoints."
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "IR tools"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal userinit.exe usage."
      - "Medium: Suspicious or anomalous use."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious userinit abuse."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed."
      - "Low: Legitimate usage."

ioc_types:
  - "Unusual userinit.exe command lines"
  - "Registry modifications for persistence"
  - "Userinit executed outside logon"
