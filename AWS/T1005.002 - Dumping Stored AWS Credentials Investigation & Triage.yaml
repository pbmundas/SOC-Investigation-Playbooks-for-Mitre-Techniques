playbook_name: "T1005.002 - Dumping Stored AWS Credentials: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1005.002"
technique_name: "Dumping Stored AWS Credentials"
description: >
  Detect attempts to access or exfiltrate stored AWS credentials, including access keys and secret keys stored in environment variables, configuration files, or metadata services.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to AWS Credential Storage Locations"
    description: >
      Detect suspicious reads or copies of AWS credential files or environment variables.
    checklist:
      - "Are credentials accessed by non-standard or unauthorized processes?"
      - "Is there unusual access to ~/.aws/credentials or environment variables?"
      - "Is the EC2 metadata service being queried unusually?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "CloudTrail (for API calls to instance metadata service)"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Unusual API or CLI Usage with Stored Credentials"
    description: >
      Identify activity originating from stored credentials indicative of compromise.
    checklist:
      - "Are access keys used from unusual IPs or locations?"
      - "Is there abnormal API activity inconsistent with normal user behavior?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "AWS Config"
      - "Network logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Credential Access or Exfiltration Attempts"
    description: >
      Look for lateral movement, data downloads, or suspicious command executions after credential access.
    checklist:
      - "Is there data exfiltration or resource enumeration post credential access?"
      - "Are there attempts to disable logging or rotate credentials?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "SIEM alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized access to credentials."
      - "Medium: Unusual credential access needing review."
      - "High: Unauthorized credential dumping and misuse."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Direct evidence of credential theft and abuse."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access patterns."
      - "Low: Potential false positives from monitoring gaps."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to ~/.aws/credentials or environment variables"
  - "Unusual metadata service API calls"
  - "API calls from anomalous IPs with stored credentials"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect EC2 Metadata Service Access"
    query: >

  - name: "Detect Access to AWS Credentials File on Endpoints"
    query: >
      file.path:"~/.aws/credentials" AND process.name NOT IN ("authorized processes")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious access to credential files or metadata."
  - "Block unauthorized processes accessing credentials."
  - "Trigger credential rotation and incident response."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify access legitimacy with endpoint owners."
  - "Rotate credentials immediately if compromise suspected."
  - "Investigate for lateral movement or exfiltration."
