tactic: "Persistence"

technique_name: "Hijack Execution Flow"
description: >
  Playbook to investigate suspicious hijacking of execution flow via DLL hijacking, binary planting, 
  or hijacking of search order used by adversaries to execute malicious code.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Abnormal DLL or Binary Loads"
    description: >
      Identify DLL or executable files loaded from unexpected locations or by suspicious processes.
    checklist:
      - "Are there DLLs loaded from writable or user directories?"
      - "Is the load order manipulated or binary replaced?"
      - "Are there unsigned or modified DLLs or executables?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process DLL load logs"
      - "File Integrity Monitoring"
      - "EDR hooks and monitoring"
      - "Windows Event Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Process Parent-Child Relationships"
    description: >
      Examine execution chains for anomalous spawning of processes or binaries.
    checklist:
      - "Are processes launched from unexpected parents?"
      - "Is there evidence of binary planting or execution flow hijack?"
      - "Do process command lines or modules show suspicious indicators?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process trees"
      - "Command line auditing"
      - "Threat intelligence"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Check for Persistence or Lateral Movement"
    description: >
      Assess whether hijacked execution flows are leveraged for persistence or further attack stages.
    checklist:
      - "Is hijacked code used to establish persistence?"
      - "Are there connections to C2 or lateral movement after hijack?"
      - "Are scheduled tasks or services involved?"
    data_sources:
      - "Persistence mechanism logs"
      - "Network traffic analysis"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate User and System Context"
    description: >
      Confirm whether hijack events correspond to authorized activity.
    checklist:
      - "Is the activity initiated by trusted users or processes?"
      - "Are there known vulnerabilities exploited?"
      - "Is endpoint protection disabled or bypassed?"
    data_sources:
      - "User login/audit logs"
      - "Patch management records"
      - "EDR alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate software updates or behavior."
      - "Medium: Suspicious hijack attempts without confirmed impact."
      - "High: Confirmed hijack with malicious payload execution."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matched IOC or confirmed malware behavior."
      - "Medium: Indicators of suspicious execution flow."
      - "Low: Expected system activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious DLL or binary file paths and hashes"
  - "Process execution trees with abnormal parents"
  - "Modified or replaced executables"
  - "Scheduled tasks or services linked to hijack"
  - "Network connections following hijack"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect DLL Loading from Unusual Locations"
    query: >
      event.action:"dll_loaded" AND NOT file.path:("C:\\Windows\\System32\\*") AND
      event.timestamp:>=now-1d
  - name: "Suspicious Process Parent-Child Chains"
    query: >
      process.parent.name:("explorer.exe" OR "svchost.exe") AND
      process.name:("cmd.exe" OR "powershell.exe") AND
      process.command_line:("*-EncodedCommand*" OR "*Invoke-Expression*")
  - name: "Binary Planting or Replacement Detection"
    query: >
      file.creation_time:>=now-7d AND
      file.path:("*\\AppData\\*" OR "*\\Temp\\*") AND
      file.hash:exists

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on DLL loads from writable directories"
  - "Trigger automated file hash lookup and sandboxing"
  - "Block execution of suspicious binaries via endpoint protection"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review unusual DLL and binary loading activities."
  - "Analyze process trees for hijacked execution patterns."
  - "Check patch levels and exploit indicators."
  - "Coordinate with threat intel to confirm malicious activity."
