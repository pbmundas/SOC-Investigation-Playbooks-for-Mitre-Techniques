playbook_name: "T1134.003 - Primary Token Manipulation Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Privilege Escalation"
technique_id: "T1134.003"
technique_name: "Make and Impersonate a Primary Token"
description: >
  Detect attempts to manipulate or create primary tokens that allow adversaries to execute processes under different user contexts for privilege escalation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Primary Token Creation APIs"
    description: >
      Detect calls to DuplicateTokenEx and CreateProcessAsUser, especially in untrusted contexts.
    checklist:
      - "Was DuplicateTokenEx called by a non-admin process?"
      - "Was CreateProcessAsUser invoked without an interactive session?"
    data_sources:
      - "API telemetry"
      - "Token logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Verify Token and Process Context"
    description: >
      Confirm legitimacy of primary token usage.
    checklist:
      - "Does the user context of the token align with the spawning process?"
      - "Does the spawned process reflect token privileges?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process tree analysis"
      - "Authentication logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Privilege Escalation Indicators"
    description: >
      Identify if the token activity led to privilege elevation.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of access to privileged resources post-token creation?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM events"
      - "File access logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Internal impersonation for service execution."
      - "Medium: Unexpected token creation in user sessions."
      - "High: Confirmed token use for unauthorized privilege."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known token abuse behavior."
      - "Medium: Anomalous but unconfirmed usage."
      - "Low: Token activity not aligned with escalation."
