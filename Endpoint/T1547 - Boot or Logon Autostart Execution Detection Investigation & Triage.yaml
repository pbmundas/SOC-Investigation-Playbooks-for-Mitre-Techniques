playbook_name: "T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1547"
technique_name: "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution"
description: >
  Investigate techniques adversaries use to execute code during system boot or user logon by modifying autostart mechanisms.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify New or Modified Autostart Entries"
    description: >
      Detect changes in boot or logon autostart locations such as services, scheduled tasks, and bootloaders.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new or modified services or drivers?"
      - "Are scheduled tasks added or changed?"
      - "Are there suspicious entries in startup folders or bootloaders?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Event Logs (Service Control Manager)"
      - "Scheduled Task logs"
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Registry monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Executable Files in Autostart Entries"
    description: >
      Examine executables and scripts configured to run automatically.
    checklist:
      - "Are executables signed and trusted?"
      - "Do file hashes match known malicious artifacts?"
      - "Are there unusual file paths or names?"
    data_sources:
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"
      - "Threat intelligence"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Review System and User Boot/Logon Activity"
    description: >
      Correlate autostart execution with system and user boot or login events.
    checklist:
      - "Are there abnormal boot times or failures?"
      - "Are unexpected processes spawned at logon?"
      - "Is there evidence of persistence or lateral movement?"
    data_sources:
      - "System logs"
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Network logs"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate Changes with Baseline and User Context"
    description: >
      Confirm legitimacy of autostart modifications.
    checklist:
      - "Is the change approved by IT or user?"
      - "Are endpoint protections active?"
      - "Are patches applied to address vulnerabilities?"
    data_sources:
      - "Change management logs"
      - "Patch management"
      - "EDR alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized autostart changes."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed autostart modifications."
      - "High: Malicious autostart entry confirmed."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matched known malware or attacker TTPs."
      - "Medium: Anomalous but unverified autostart entries."
      - "Low: Legitimate but unusual changes."

ioc_types:
  - "Registry run keys and services"
  - "Scheduled task definitions"
  - "Executable file hashes"
  - "Process creation and parent-child relationships"

queries/examples:
  - name: "New or Modified Windows Services"
    query: >
      event.provider:"Service Control Manager" AND event.action:"service_created" OR event.action:"service_modified"
  - name: "Suspicious Scheduled Tasks"
    query: >
      scheduled_task.name:* AND scheduled_task.action.path:("*\\Temp\\*" OR "*\\Users\\*")
  - name: "Autostart Executable in Startup Folder"
    query: >
      file.path:"C:\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\*"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on creation/modification of autostart entries"
  - "Block unsigned or suspicious executables in autostart"
  - "Quarantine or rollback unauthorized changes"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify with change management and user reports."
  - "Check file signatures and hashes."
  - "Investigate parent processes and command lines."
  - "Correlate with other suspicious activity."
