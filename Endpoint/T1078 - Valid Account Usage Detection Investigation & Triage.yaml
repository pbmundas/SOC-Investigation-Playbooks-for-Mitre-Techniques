  focusing on anomalous authentication behavior, lateral movement, and credential abuse.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Authentication Event Review"
    description: >
      Identify the initial alert — suspicious login or access event.
    checklist:
      - "Which user account was used?"
      - "Was the login successful or failed?"
      - "What authentication method was used (password, token, RDP, VPN)?"
      - "What is the source IP/location?"
      - "Is this login consistent with the user’s typical behavior?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Security Logs (4624/4625/4648)"
      - "Linux auth logs (/var/log/auth.log)"
      - "VPN, RDP, SSH logs"
      - "SIEM Alerts"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Anomaly Detection (Time & Location)"
    description: >
      Analyze login patterns for signs of compromise or credential sharing.
    checklist:
      - "Is this login from a new country/device?"
      - "Was this a login at unusual hours (off-shift, weekend)?"
      - "Is the IP geolocation consistent with user’s profile?"
      - "Has the user account been inactive recently?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "GeoIP threat feeds"
      - "UEBA baselines"
      - "Endpoint telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Lateral Movement Check"
    description: >
      Determine if the account was used to pivot or access internal systems.
    checklist:
      - "Are there signs of SMB, RDP, WinRM, or SSH usage post-authentication?"
      - "Was PsExec, WMI, or PowerShell used remotely?"
      - "Any remote service ticket use (Kerberos TGS) from new hosts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Event Logs (4688, 4648, 4769)"
      - "Sysmon Logs"
      - "Endpoint EDR"
      - "Firewall/NetFlow Logs"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Account Privilege Review"
    description: >
      Assess whether the account has elevated access and is being abused.
    checklist:
      - "Is the account a domain admin, service, or shared admin account?"
      - "Were privilege escalation attempts logged (e.g., SID history tampering)?"
      - "Has the user accessed critical systems or sensitive shares?"
    data_sources:
      - "Active Directory logs"
      - "Access Control Logs"
      - "Group Membership Logs"
      - "SIEM Enrichment"

  - step_number: 5
    title: "Scope of Access"
    description: >
      Identify what the attacker may have accessed using the compromised account.
    checklist:
      - "What shares or files were accessed?"
      - "Were any new processes spawned or scheduled?"
      - "Was any data transferred or exfiltrated?"
    data_sources:
      - "File Access Logs (Object Access Auditing)"
      - "EDR Process Logs"
      - "Proxy/Firewall Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Single failed login from uncommon location"
      - "Medium: Successful login from suspicious IP, no lateral movement"
      - "High: Successful login, lateral movement, or access to sensitive data"
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: MFA bypass or confirmed credential reuse"
      - "Medium: Known IP but off-hours access"
      - "Low: Unusual login but no evidence of misuse"

ioc_types:
  - "Username"
  - "Source IP address"
  - "Logon type"
  - "Target hostname"
  - "Authentication method"
  - "Kerberos TGT/TGS patterns"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Windows Login from External IP"
    query: >
      EventID:4624 AND LogonType:10 AND NOT (IpAddress IN trusted_vpn_ranges)
  - name: "Remote Process Creation"
    query: >
      EventID:4688 AND ParentCommandLine:*psexec* OR *wmic* OR *winrm*
  - name: "Kerberos Lateral Movement Indicator"

automation_hooks:
  - "Trigger UEBA comparison on user behavior"
  - "Auto-tag known good logins (VPN, SSO)"
  - "Enrich source IP with threat intel"
  - "Isolate host if high-risk activity is observed"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Correlate successful login with endpoint behavior post-authentication"
  - "Investigate logon types: LogonType 3 (network), 10 (RDP), 2 (console)"
  - "Prioritize privileged or service accounts"
  - "Work with IAM team to reset compromised accounts and rotate credentials"
