playbook_name: "T1550.004 - SID-History Injection Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1550.004"
technique_name: "SID-History Injection"
description: >
  Detects injection or manipulation of Security Identifier (SID) history attributes to escalate privileges or maintain access.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Changes to SID-History Attributes"
    description: >
      Detect modifications to SID-History attributes in Active Directory user or group objects.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected changes to SID-History?"
      - "Is SID-History added to accounts that should not have it?"
    data_sources:
      - "Active Directory logs"
      - "Security event logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Unauthorized Privilege Escalation via SID-History"
    description: >
      Correlate SID-History changes with elevated privileges or group memberships.
    checklist:
      - "Did SID-History injection lead to unexpected access?"
      - "Are there changes in group memberships related to SID-History?"
    data_sources:
      - "Access control logs"
      - "Group membership change logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Credential Theft or Persistence Activities"
    description: >
      Investigate if SID-History injection is part of a broader persistence or lateral movement tactic.
    checklist:
      - "Is SID-History injection preceded or followed by credential dumping?"
      - "Are there other indicators of persistence?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "Process execution logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: SID-History changes in test or inactive accounts."
      - "Medium: Suspicious SID-History injection without clear impact."
      - "High: Confirmed privilege escalation or persistence via SID-History."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified unauthorized SID-History injection."
      - "Medium: Suspicious changes pending further confirmation."
      - "Low: Legitimate SID-History modifications."

ioc_types:
  - "Modification of SID-History attributes in AD"
  - "Unexpected group memberships linked to SID-History"
  - "Changes to privileged accounts SID-History"
