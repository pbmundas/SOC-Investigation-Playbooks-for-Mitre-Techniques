tactic: "Defense Evasion"

description: >
  Detect TLS callback injection, a technique where adversaries use Thread Local Storage callbacks to execute malicious code during DLL load time.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor TLS Callback Sections in DLLs"
    description: >
      Detect presence of TLS callbacks in non-standard or unsigned DLLs.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected TLS callbacks in loaded modules?"
      - "Are TLS callbacks pointing to suspicious code areas?"
    data_sources:
      - "Static analysis tools"
      - "DLL load events"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate with DLL Injection Techniques"
    description: >
      Determine if TLS callbacks are used post-DLL injection.
    checklist:
      - "Are DLLs loaded from user-writeable locations?"
      - "Are callbacks executing during thread initialization?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR logs"
      - "Memory analysis"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Track Execution from TLS Callback Regions"
    description: >
      Map execution flow starting from TLS sections.
    checklist:
      - "Are TLS callbacks linked to shellcode or unpacked malware?"
      - "Do they lead to privilege escalation or persistence?"
    data_sources:
      - "Memory dump analysis"
      - "SIEM alerts"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate and Respond"
    description: >
      Confirm malicious TLS injection and isolate host.
    checklist:
      - "Is the TLS region behaving maliciously?"
      - "Is endpoint isolation or reboot necessary?"
    data_sources:
      - "IR response logs"
      - "Sandbox reports"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Debug or dev DLLs with TLS sections."
      - "Medium: Unknown TLS regions in DLLs."
      - "High: Confirmed malware using TLS callback."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Callback matches known threat behavior."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unknown TLS use."
      - "Low: Infrequent legitimate usage."
