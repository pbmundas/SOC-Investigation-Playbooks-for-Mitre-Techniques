playbook_name: "T1123 - Audio Capture Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1123"
technique_name: "Audio Capture"
description: >
  Detects adversaries capturing audio via microphones on compromised systems to gather sensitive information or eavesdrop on conversations.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Microphone Access Events"
    description: >
      Identify processes accessing microphone devices or audio input APIs.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual or unauthorized applications accessing audio capture devices?"
      - "Is microphone access occurring during odd hours or from unexpected users?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs (e.g., Windows Audio subsystem, macOS CoreAudio)"
      - "Process creation and file access logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Audio Recording or Streaming Activity"
    description: >
      Look for signs of audio recording files creation or live streaming transmissions.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new audio files (.wav, .mp3, .aac) created by suspicious processes?"
      - "Is there network traffic consistent with streaming or uploading audio data?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Network monitoring and DPI logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with User and Process Behavior"
    description: >
      Assess if audio capture activity is associated with known malicious tools or suspicious user accounts.
    checklist:
      - "Is microphone access linked to known adversary tools?"
      - "Are suspicious processes running with elevated privileges?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"
      - "Process and user activity logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized application access to microphone."
      - "Medium: Unusual microphone access needing review."
      - "High: Unauthorized audio capture detected."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious audio capture activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious microphone access without full context."
      - "Low: Routine microphone usage by known apps."

ioc_types:
  - "Processes accessing audio capture APIs or devices"
  - "Creation of audio recording files by non-standard apps"
  - "Unusual network traffic corresponding to audio data upload"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Microphone Access by Unusual Processes"
    query: >
      process.name NOT IN ("explorer.exe", "Skype.exe", "Teams.exe") AND
      file.access CONTAINS "mic" OR "audio_input"

  - name: "Detect New Audio File Creation"
    query: >
      file.extension IN (".wav", ".mp3", ".aac") AND
      process.user NOT IN ("AuthorizedUserList")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious microphone access or audio file creation."
  - "Block or quarantine unauthorized audio capture processes."
  - "Notify SOC and escalate for immediate investigation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if microphone usage is expected and authorized."
  - "Check related network traffic for data exfiltration."
  - "Recommend endpoint audio device controls and user awareness."
