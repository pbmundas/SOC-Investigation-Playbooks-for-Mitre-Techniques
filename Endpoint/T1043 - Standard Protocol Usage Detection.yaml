playbook_name: "T1043 - Standard Protocol Usage Detection"
tactic: "Command and Control"
technique_id: "T1043"
technique_name: "Standard Application Layer Protocol"
description: >
  Detect adversaries using common application layer protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc.) for command and control to blend with normal traffic.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Network Traffic on Standard Protocols"
    description: >
      Analyze network traffic for unusual patterns or volumes on common protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS.
    checklist:
      - "Are there anomalies in request frequency, size, or timing?"
      - "Is communication occurring to unusual or suspicious domains?"
      - "Are there uncommon user-agent strings or headers in HTTP traffic?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "Proxy and firewall logs"
      - "DNS query logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Inspect Encrypted Traffic for Anomalies"
    description: >
      Since HTTPS is encrypted, look for metadata anomalies such as unusual certificates or TLS versions.
    checklist:
      - "Are there self-signed or unusual certificates?"
      - "Is there traffic to suspicious IP addresses or domains with valid certs?"
    data_sources:
      - "TLS/SSL inspection logs"
      - "Network metadata"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Endpoint and Process Activity"
    description: >
      Identify which processes or users are generating the network traffic.
    checklist:
      - "Are legitimate processes responsible or suspicious executables?"
      - "Are there process command line anomalies?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint process logs"
      - "EDR telemetry"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Expected protocol usage."
      - "Medium: Suspicious patterns."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious C2 over standard protocols."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: IOC or signature match."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Potential false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious domains or IPs"
  - "Anomalous HTTP headers or user agents"
  - "Unusual TLS certificates"
