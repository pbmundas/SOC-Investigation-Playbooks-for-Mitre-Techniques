playbook_name: "T1125 - Video Capture Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1125"
technique_name: "Video Capture"
description: >
  Detects adversaries capturing video from webcams or screen capture to steal sensitive visual information or for surveillance.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Webcam or Video Device Access"
    description: >
      Detect processes accessing webcam devices or screen capture APIs.
    checklist:
      - "Are there processes accessing video capture hardware unexpectedly?"
      - "Is there unusual timing or frequency of webcam activation?"
    data_sources:
      - "System and device logs (e.g., Windows Device Manager events)"
      - "Process and file access logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Video Recording or Streaming"
    description: >
      Identify creation of video files or streaming of live video feeds.
    checklist:
      - "Are new video files (.mp4, .avi, .mov) created by unknown or suspicious processes?"
      - "Is there network traffic indicative of live video streaming or upload?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Network traffic logs and deep packet inspection"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Access with Malicious Behavior"
    description: >
      Link video capture activity with suspicious user accounts or known malware.
    checklist:
      - "Is webcam access linked to known adversary tools?"
      - "Are related suspicious processes running concurrently?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence"
      - "Process execution and user activity logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate use of webcam or screen capture."
      - "Medium: Unusual or unapproved video capture detected."
      - "High: Unauthorized video capture or streaming confirmed."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious video capture activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious device access without full context."
      - "Low: Normal video capture by approved applications."

ioc_types:
  - "Processes accessing video capture devices"
  - "Creation of suspicious video files"
  - "Network streaming traffic related to video data"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Webcam Access by Unknown Processes"
    query: >
      process.name NOT IN ("Zoom.exe", "Teams.exe", "Skype.exe") AND
      file.access CONTAINS "video_capture" OR "webcam"

  - name: "Detect New Video File Creation"
    query: >
      file.extension IN (".mp4", ".avi", ".mov") AND
      process.user NOT IN ("AuthorizedUserList")

automation_hooks:
  - "Generate alerts on unauthorized video device access."
  - "Block suspicious processes attempting video capture."
  - "Notify security team for rapid investigation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if video capture activity is legitimate."
  - "Investigate network traffic for possible video data exfiltration."
  - "Enforce endpoint camera usage policies and user education."
