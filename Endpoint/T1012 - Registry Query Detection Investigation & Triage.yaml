playbook_name: "T1012 - Registry Query Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1012"
technique_name: "Registry Query"
description: >
  Detects adversaries querying the Windows Registry to collect system or configuration information useful for further exploitation or reconnaissance.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Registry Query Commands and API Calls"
    description: >
      Identify processes querying registry keys, especially those related to system, software, and security configurations.
    checklist:
      - "Are suspicious processes querying sensitive registry paths?"
      - "Is reg.exe or PowerShell querying registry keys?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Registry access monitoring"
      - "Command-line auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Unusual Registry Access Patterns"
    description: >
      Detect high-volume or abnormal registry query activity from unexpected users or processes.
    checklist:
      - "Are registry queries performed outside normal operational patterns?"
      - "Are multiple registry keys queried in rapid succession?"
    data_sources:
      - "User activity logs"
      - "Endpoint monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Registry Queries with Other Reconnaissance or Lateral Movement"
    description: >
      Investigate if registry queries align with privilege escalation, persistence, or credential access activities.
    checklist:
      - "Are registry queries followed by suspicious process creations?"
      - "Is there evidence of persistence mechanisms being set?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection and response logs"
      - "Security event logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Routine registry queries by authorized processes."
      - "Medium: Multiple queries by suspicious processes or users."
      - "High: Registry queries linked to active intrusion or persistence."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized registry queries."
      - "Medium: Suspicious queries pending validation."
      - "Low: Normal administrative activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of reg.exe query commands"
  - "PowerShell scripts accessing registry keys"
  - "API calls querying sensitive registry paths"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect reg.exe Query Command"
    query: >
      process.name == "reg.exe" AND
      process.command_line CONTAINS "query"

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Registry Access"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-ItemProperty|Get-Item"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious registry query commands."
  - "Restrict reg.exe usage to authorized users."
  - "Monitor for persistence-related registry changes."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify legitimacy of registry queries."
  - "Correlate with other suspicious system activity."
  - "Recommend enhanced endpoint security and monitoring."
