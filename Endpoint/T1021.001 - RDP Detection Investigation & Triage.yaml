playbook_name: "T1021.001 - RDP Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Lateral Movement"
technique_id: "T1021.001"
technique_name: "Remote Desktop Protocol"
description: >
  Detects adversaries using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement or remote control.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor RDP Connection Attempts"
    description: >
      Track inbound network connections to RDP port (3389) and detect connection patterns.
    checklist:
      - "Are there repeated or unusual connection attempts to port 3389?"
      - "Are connections originating from suspicious IP addresses or geolocations?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic logs"
      - "Firewall logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Authentication Logs for RDP"
    description: >
      Review successful and failed RDP login attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there multiple failed login attempts suggesting brute force?"
      - "Are successful logins from unusual accounts or sources?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Security Event Logs (Event ID 4624, 4625)"
      - "Remote Desktop logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate RDP Sessions with Post-Access Activities"
    description: >
      Investigate activities following RDP logins such as new process launches, lateral movement, or data access.
    checklist:
      - "Is there abnormal process creation or file access during or after RDP sessions?"
      - "Are there privilege escalations or suspicious network connections?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "File access logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized RDP sessions from known users."
      - "Medium: RDP access outside of business hours or unusual IPs."
      - "High: Unauthorized or brute force RDP attempts."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized or brute force RDP access."
      - "Medium: Suspicious RDP connection patterns."
      - "Low: Normal remote administration."

ioc_types:
  - "Network connections to port 3389"
  - "Failed and successful RDP login attempts"
  - "Abnormal process or file activity after RDP login"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect RDP Network Connections"
    query: >
      network.destination_port == 3389 AND network.direction == "inbound"

  - name: "Detect RDP Failed Logins"
    query: >
      event.id == 4625 AND event.data.LogonType == 10

  - name: "Detect RDP Successful Logins"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on multiple failed RDP login attempts."
  - "Block suspicious IP addresses targeting RDP."
  - "Require multi-factor authentication for RDP."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate source and legitimacy of RDP sessions."
  - "Investigate follow-up activities post-RDP access."
  - "Recommend hardening RDP access and monitoring."
