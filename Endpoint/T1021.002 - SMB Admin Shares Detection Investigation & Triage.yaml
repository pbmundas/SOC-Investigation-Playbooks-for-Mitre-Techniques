playbook_name: "T1021.002 - SMB Admin Shares Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Lateral Movement"
technique_id: "T1021.002"
technique_name: "SMB/Windows Admin Shares"
description: >
  Detects adversaries leveraging SMB admin shares (e.g., C$, ADMIN$) for lateral movement or remote file access.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to SMB Admin Shares"
    description: >
      Track connections and accesses to SMB administrative shares on endpoints.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected or unauthorized connections to admin shares?"
      - "Are access attempts coming from unusual user accounts or hosts?"
    data_sources:
      - "SMB access logs"
      - "Network connection logs"
      - "File access logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Remote Execution Over SMB Shares"
    description: >
      Identify suspicious remote process creations or file transfers over SMB admin shares.
    checklist:
      - "Are files copied to admin shares without authorization?"
      - "Is there evidence of remote execution commands?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "File transfer logs"
      - "SMB audit logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate SMB Admin Access with Other Lateral Movement Indicators"
    description: >
      Look for subsequent malicious activity such as privilege escalation, credential dumping, or persistence.
    checklist:
      - "Are there logins or new sessions initiated after SMB admin share access?"
      - "Is there unusual privilege use or account behavior?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Process logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Admin share access by authorized admins."
      - "Medium: Unusual but non-malicious admin share usage."
      - "High: Unauthorized or suspicious admin share access."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized SMB admin share access."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access patterns."
      - "Low: Routine admin activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to C$, ADMIN$, IPC$ shares over SMB"
  - "Remote file copies or execution over SMB"
  - "Unusual user or host access to admin shares"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Access to SMB Admin Shares"
    query: >
      network.destination_port == 445 AND
      file.path MATCHES ".*\\\\(C\\$|ADMIN\\$|IPC\\$)\\\\.*"

  - name: "Detect Remote Execution Commands Over SMB"
    query: >
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)(psexec|wmiexec|smbclient)" AND

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized SMB admin share access."
  - "Block suspicious IP addresses or user accounts."
  - "Quarantine affected systems for further investigation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if SMB admin share access is authorized."
  - "Investigate any lateral movement activity."
  - "Recommend restricting SMB admin shares where possible."
