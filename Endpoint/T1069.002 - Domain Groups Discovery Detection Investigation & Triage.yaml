playbook_name: "T1069.002 - Domain Groups Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1069.002"
technique_name: "Domain Groups Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries enumerating domain groups to gather information on user privileges and group memberships across the domain, useful for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Domain Group Enumeration Commands and Queries"
    description: >
      Identify execution of commands such as `net group /domain`, `Get-ADGroup`, LDAP queries, or PowerShell cmdlets querying domain group memberships.
    checklist:
      - "Are domain group enumeration commands or LDAP queries detected?"
      - "Are queries performed by unauthorized or suspicious accounts?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Active Directory query logs"
      - "PowerShell and LDAP monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Suspicious or High-Volume Domain Group Queries"
    description: >
      Look for multiple or bulk queries for domain group information in a short time frame, especially targeting privileged groups.
    checklist:
      - "Is there enumeration of sensitive or admin domain groups?"
      - "Are queries executed from unusual systems or user accounts?"
    data_sources:
      - "AD logs"
      - "User activity logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Domain Group Discovery with Privilege Escalation or Lateral Movement"
    description: >
      Assess if domain group enumeration is followed by attempts to access privileged resources or escalate privileges.
    checklist:
      - "Are suspicious logins or access attempts observed after discovery?"
      - "Is there evidence of privilege abuse or credential theft?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Domain group enumeration by authorized admins."
      - "Medium: Enumeration by standard users or during unusual times."
      - "High: Enumeration linked to suspicious or malicious activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized domain group enumeration."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed."
      - "Low: Legitimate administrative activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Commands like `net group /domain`"
  - "PowerShell cmdlets such as `Get-ADGroup` querying domain groups"
  - "LDAP queries for domain group enumeration"
  - "Unusual user or system initiating domain group queries"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect net group /domain Command"
    query: >
      process.name == "net.exe" AND
      process.command_line CONTAINS "group /domain"

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Domain Group Queries"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-ADGroup"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized domain group enumeration."
  - "Restrict LDAP and AD query access to authorized users."
  - "Investigate suspicious querying accounts."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if domain group enumeration is part of normal admin tasks."
  - "Correlate with lateral movement or privilege escalation indicators."
  - "Recommend tightening AD query permissions and monitoring."
