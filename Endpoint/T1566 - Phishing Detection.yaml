description: >
  This playbook guides SOC analysts through detecting, investigating, and responding to phishing attempts.
  It covers email analysis, user interaction verification, payload inspection, and containment measures.

  - Email Security Solutions (ATP Sandboxing)
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  - SIEM Alerting on Suspicious Email Events
  - User Behavior Analytics (UBA/UEBA)
  - Network Proxy and DNS Logs

  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Potential Phishing Email"
    description: >
      Examine email headers, sender reputation, and message characteristics.
    checklist:
      - "Check for spoofed or suspicious sender domain"
      - "Review SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation results"
      - "Look for known phishing indicators in subject or body"
      - "Analyze embedded URLs and attachments"
    data_sources:
      - "Email gateway logs"
      - "Email headers and metadata"
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Attachments and URLs"
    description: >
      Investigate any links or files for malicious payloads or redirection.
    checklist:
      - "Submit attachments to sandbox or antivirus for analysis"
      - "Check URLs against threat intelligence or URL reputation services"
      - "Determine if attachments have macros or executables"
    data_sources:
      - "Sandbox reports"
      - "VirusTotal or similar"
      - "Threat intel platforms"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Assess User Interaction"
    description: >
      Determine if users clicked links, downloaded attachments, or provided credentials.
    checklist:
      - "Review email client logs or proxy logs for clicks"
      - "Check EDR for any execution triggered by email"
      - "Correlate with UEBA for abnormal user behavior"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR telemetry"
      - "Proxy/web logs"
      - "UEBA reports"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Containment and Mitigation"
    description: >
      Act to limit the phishing campaign impact and prevent lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Block sender and URLs at email gateway and proxy"
      - "Quarantine or delete suspicious emails"
      - "Isolate compromised hosts"
      - "Force password resets if credential compromise suspected"
    data_sources:
      - "Email gateway controls"
      - "Network firewalls/proxy"
      - "Identity management systems"

  - step_number: 5
    title: "User Awareness and Reporting"
    description: >
      Notify and educate impacted users and stakeholders.
    checklist:
      - "Send phishing alert notifications to users"
      - "Provide guidance on spotting phishing"
      - "Collect additional user feedback or reports"
    data_sources:
      - "Security awareness platform"
      - "Internal communication channels"

triage_labels:
  - severity:
      - "Low: Email flagged but no user interaction"
      - "Medium: User clicked link but no malicious execution"
      - "High: Payload executed or credential compromise suspected"
  - confidence:
      - "High: Confirmed phishing indicators and payload"
      - "Medium: Suspicious indicators, but unclear impact"
      - "Low: Potential false positive or user error"

ioc_types:
  - Email Address
  - Sender Domain
  - IP Address
  - URL
  - File Hash
  - Attachment Filename

example_queries:
  - name: "Suspicious Email Sender Detection"
    query: >
      email_sender_domain IN ("phishingsite.com", "malicious.com") OR
      email_subject CONTAINS ("urgent", "password reset", "invoice")

  - name: "Attachment Execution After Email"
    query: >
      event_type=process_creation AND
      parent_process_name="outlook.exe" AND
      (process_name="powershell.exe" OR process_name="cmd.exe")

automation_hooks:
  - "Auto quarantine emails with high-confidence phishing indicators"
  - "Trigger sandbox analysis for unknown attachments"
  - "Generate tickets for analyst review"
  - "Notify users in impacted departments"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Focus first on emails with links or attachments flagged by sandbox or AV"
  - "Correlate email activity with endpoint events to detect payload execution"
  - "Verify sender authenticity via email headers"
  - "Engage users for additional context and awareness"
