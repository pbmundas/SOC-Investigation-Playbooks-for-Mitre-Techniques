playbook_name: "T1204.002 - User Execution via Malicious File"
tactic: "Execution"
technique_id: "T1204.002"
technique_name: "User Execution: Malicious File"
description: >
  This playbook provides guidance for detecting, investigating, and responding to the execution of a malicious file
  triggered by a user. Common vectors include email attachments, drive-by downloads, or removable media. 
  Focus is on initial execution behavior and potential follow-up activity.

detection_sources:
  - EDR/Process Monitoring (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 1, 11)
  - Email Gateway (e.g., O365 ATP, Proofpoint)
  - File Integrity Monitoring
  - Antivirus/Endpoint Protection Alerts
  - User Behavior Analytics (UEBA)

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Confirm Execution of Malicious File"
    description: >
      Verify whether a suspicious or malicious file was executed by the user.
    checklist:
      - "What file was executed (name, path, hash)?"
      - "What is the parent process (e.g., outlook.exe, chrome.exe)?"
      - "Is the file signed, packed, or obfuscated?"
      - "Check VT/Hybrid Analysis report for the file hash"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR telemetry"
      - "VirusTotal or sandbox integrations"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Determine File Origin and Delivery Method"
    description: >
      Identify how the file was delivered to the system.
    checklist:
      - "Was it attached to an email?"
      - "Was it downloaded from the internet?"
      - "Was it transferred via removable media?"
    data_sources:
      - "Email gateway logs"
      - "Browser history or download logs"
      - "USB activity logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Analyze Child Processes"
    description: >
      Review post-execution behavior for signs of malicious activity.
    checklist:
      - "Did it launch PowerShell, cmd, or other scripting tools?"
      - "Any LOLBin usage (e.g., mshta, regsvr32)?"
      - "Did it initiate network connections?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Network connection logs (Sysmon ID 3, firewall)"
      - "EDR process tree view"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Check for Persistence or Payload Drop"
    description: >
      Investigate whether the file dropped a payload or installed persistence.
    checklist:
      - "Any registry modifications?"
      - "Scheduled tasks or autoruns?"
      - "Any suspicious files dropped post-execution?"
    data_sources:
      - "Autoruns"
      - "Registry and scheduled task logs"
      - "Antivirus detections"

  - step_number: 5
    title: "User Verification and Intent"
    description: >
      Understand if the user was tricked or complicit in running the file.
    checklist:
      - "Did the file come from a spoofed or unexpected source?"
      - "Is this common behavior for the user?"
      - "Any previous incidents linked to this user?"
    data_sources:
      - "Email headers and body"
      - "UEBA and access patterns"
      - "HR or security awareness training records"

triage_labels:
  - severity:
      - "Low: Unknown executable with no follow-up activity"
      - "Medium: Unsigned executable triggers script or LOLBin"
      - "High: Executable delivers malware or persistence"
  - confidence:
      - "High: File matches known malware hash"
      - "Medium: File triggers suspicious child processes or connects externally"
      - "Low: Executable behavior unclear"

ioc_types:
  - File Hash (MD5, SHA256)
  - File Path
  - Process Name
  - Command Line
  - Email Subject/Sender
  - Destination IP/Domain

example_queries:
  - name: "Windows Suspicious Execution via Outlook"
    query: >
      EventID=1 AND ParentImage="*outlook.exe" AND (Image="*cmd.exe" OR Image="*powershell.exe")

  - name: "Linux Suspicious Execution via PDF Reader"
    query: >
      parent_process="evince" AND process="/bin/bash" OR process="/usr/bin/python"

automation_hooks:
  - "Send file hash to VirusTotal or sandbox for enrichment"
  - "Alert if file is unsigned, uncommon, or from external source"
  - "Auto-quarantine host if post-execution malware is detected"
  - "Generate ticket and assign to incident handler"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Prioritize based on source and behavior of file"
  - "Review sandbox or AV results for payload"
  - "Interview user if necessary for social engineering angle"
  - "Look for lateral movement or credential access as next steps"
