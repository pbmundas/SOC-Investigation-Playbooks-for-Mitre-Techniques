playbook_name: "T1069 - Permission Groups Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1069"
technique_name: "Permission Groups Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries enumerating permission groups to identify user privileges, group memberships, and security roles for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Group Enumeration Commands and Tools"
    description: >
      Identify use of commands like `net group`, `Get-ADGroup`, or PowerShell cmdlets querying group membership.
    checklist:
      - "Are group enumeration commands executed on endpoints or servers?"
      - "Are unusual or unauthorized accounts performing group discovery?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line auditing"
      - "Directory service query logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Abnormal Group Enumeration Activity"
    description: >
      Look for enumeration of privileged or sensitive groups by non-admin or suspicious users.
    checklist:
      - "Is group discovery focused on high-privilege groups?"
      - "Is enumeration activity concentrated in a short time frame?"
    data_sources:
      - "Active Directory logs"
      - "User activity monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Privilege Escalation or Lateral Movement Attempts"
    description: >
      Determine if group enumeration precedes or correlates with privilege escalation or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Are there signs of credential misuse following discovery?"
      - "Is suspicious account activity observed post-discovery?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Group enumeration by authorized admins."
      - "Medium: Enumeration by non-privileged users."
      - "High: Discovery linked to privilege escalation or lateral movement."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized group enumeration."
      - "Medium: Suspicious enumeration without confirmed abuse."
      - "Low: Routine group membership audits."

ioc_types:
  - "Commands like `net group`, `Get-ADGroup`"
  - "PowerShell cmdlets querying Active Directory groups"
  - "Enumeration by suspicious users or processes"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect net group Command"
    query: >
      process.name == "net.exe" AND
      process.command_line CONTAINS "group"

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Group Queries"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-ADGroup|Get-LocalGroup"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized permission group enumeration."
  - "Restrict access to group enumeration tools."
  - "Investigate user context and correlate with privilege abuse."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm legitimacy of group enumeration."
  - "Correlate with privilege escalation attempts."
  - "Recommend limiting permissions for group query access."
