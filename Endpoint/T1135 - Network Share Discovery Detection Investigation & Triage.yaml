playbook_name: "T1135 - Network Share Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1135"
technique_name: "Network Share Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries enumerating network shares to identify accessible file shares and resources for data collection or lateral movement.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Network Share Enumeration Commands"
    description: >
      Identify use of commands/tools like `net view`, `net use`, `Get-SmbShare`, or LDAP queries used to discover network shares.
    checklist:
      - "Are commands like `net view` or PowerShell cmdlets querying SMB shares executed?"
      - "Are unusual accounts performing network share enumeration?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line auditing"
      - "Network file share logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Abnormal Network Share Access Patterns"
    description: >
      Look for unusual or large-scale network share enumeration, especially from non-admin or non-standard user accounts.
    checklist:
      - "Is there enumeration of multiple shares across many hosts?"
      - "Are network shares accessed outside of normal working hours?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access logs"
      - "User activity monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Share Discovery with Lateral Movement or Data Access"
    description: >
      Determine if share discovery activity is followed by file access or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Are shares accessed shortly after discovery?"
      - "Is there evidence of credential use or suspicious file transfers?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Network share enumeration by authorized administrators."
      - "Medium: Enumeration by non-privileged or suspicious accounts."
      - "High: Discovery linked to lateral movement or data theft."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized network share enumeration."
      - "Medium: Suspicious enumeration activity."
      - "Low: Routine IT maintenance activity."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of `net view`, `net use` commands"
  - "PowerShell cmdlets like `Get-SmbShare`"
  - "LDAP queries for shared folders"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Net View Command Usage"
    query: >
      process.name == "net.exe" AND
      process.command_line CONTAINS "view"

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Network Share Queries"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-SmbShare|Get-WmiObject.*Win32_Share"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized network share enumeration."
  - "Restrict share enumeration commands to admins."
  - "Review and limit share permissions."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate the intent and user context of network share queries."
  - "Investigate subsequent share access or file activity."
  - "Recommend tightening share access controls."
