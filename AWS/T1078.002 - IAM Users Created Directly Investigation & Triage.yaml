playbook_name: "T1078.002 - IAM Users Created Directly: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1078.002"
technique_name: "IAM Users Created Directly"
description: >
  Detect and investigate the creation and use of IAM users directly within AWS accounts, which may be employed by attackers to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify New IAM User Creation Events"
    description: >
      Monitor AWS CloudTrail for CreateUser API calls indicating new IAM user creation.
    checklist:
      - "Are new IAM users created outside approved change windows or by unauthorized principals?"
      - "Is the creation activity initiated by unexpected users or roles?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail (CreateUser, CreateLoginProfile)"
      - "AWS Config IAM user change history"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Review Newly Created IAM Usersâ€™ Permissions"
    description: >
      Analyze the permissions and policies attached to newly created IAM users for excessive or suspicious privileges.
    checklist:
      - "Do the new users have administrator or overly permissive policies?"
      - "Are the attached policies inline or managed?"
      - "Are permissions aligned with least privilege principles?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS IAM Access Advisor"
      - "AWS CloudTrail (PutUserPolicy, AttachUserPolicy)"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Detect Usage of Newly Created IAM Users"
    description: >
      Look for console logins, API calls, or key usage from newly created IAM users.
    checklist:
      - "Are new users performing API calls or console logins shortly after creation?"
      - "Is usage coming from suspicious IPs or unusual geolocations?"
      - "Is there evidence of automation or scripting using these credentials?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail (ConsoleLogin, API calls)"
      - "AWS CloudWatch logs"
      - "VPC Flow Logs"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Correlate with Other Anomalies or Indicators"
    description: >
      Investigate related suspicious activities such as policy changes, role creation, or data access linked to new IAM users.
    checklist:
      - "Are IAM policies or roles modified after new user creation?"
      - "Is there data exfiltration or unusual network traffic following user activity?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail"
      - "IAM policy change logs"
      - "Network and S3 access logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: IAM user creation during authorized administrative changes."
      - "Medium: Unexpected IAM user creation without immediate suspicious activity."
      - "High: Unauthorized IAM user creation with active suspicious usage or privilege escalation."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Direct evidence of unauthorized user creation and malicious activity."
      - "Medium: Unusual user creation requiring further validation."
      - "Low: Possible false positives from automation or delegated admin users."

ioc_types:
  - "CreateUser API events"
  - "New IAM user with administrator or unusual permissions"
  - "Console login or API calls from recently created users"
  - "Usage from anomalous IP addresses or geolocations"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect IAM User Creation"
    query: >
      eventName="CreateUser"
  - name: "Detect IAM User Console Login"
    query: >
      eventName="ConsoleLogin" AND userIdentity.userName IN ["<new IAM user list>"]
  - name: "Detect Excessive Permissions Assigned"
    query: >
      eventName IN ["PutUserPolicy", "AttachUserPolicy"] AND userIdentity.userName IN ["<new IAM user list>"]

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on new IAM user creation by unexpected principals."
  - "Trigger review workflow for permissions attached to new users."
  - "Block or disable newly created users pending investigation if suspicious."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify new user creation with identity and access management teams."
  - "Assess necessity and appropriateness of permissions granted."
  - "Check for any abnormal usage patterns or privilege escalations."
  - "Revoke or remediate unauthorized IAM users immediately."
