playbook_name: "T1201 - Password Policy Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1201"
technique_name: "Password Policy Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries querying or enumerating password policy configurations to understand password complexity, expiration, or lockout policies that may help plan brute force or credential attacks.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Queries to Password Policy Settings"
    description: >
      Monitor LDAP queries, Group Policy Object (GPO) inspections, or commands querying password policies.
    checklist:
      - "Are password policy attributes queried via LDAP or PowerShell?"
      - "Are queries performed by unusual accounts or systems?"
    data_sources:
      - "LDAP logs"
      - "PowerShell logs"
      - "GPO auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Scripts or Tools Enumerating Password Policies"
    description: >
      Identify execution of scripts or tools designed for password policy discovery.
    checklist:
      - "Are known discovery tools or custom scripts detected?"
      - "Are scripts run outside authorized maintenance windows?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Script execution logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Discovery Activity with Subsequent Credential Attacks"
    description: >
      Analyze if password policy discovery is followed by brute force or credential stuffing attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Is there increased failed login attempts after policy queries?"
      - "Are there signs of account lockouts or suspicious authentications?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Account lockout monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Policy queries by authorized admins."
      - "Medium: Queries by users without clear justification."
      - "High: Queries linked with credential attacks."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized password policy discovery."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed."
      - "Low: Legitimate administrative activity."

ioc_types:
  - "LDAP queries for password policies"
  - "PowerShell commands querying password policies"
  - "Execution of password policy discovery tools"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect LDAP Password Policy Queries"
    query: >
      ldap.query.attributes CONTAINS ("pwdPolicy", "minPwdLength", "lockoutDuration")

  - name: "Detect PowerShell Password Policy Queries"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy|Get-ADFineGrainedPasswordPolicy"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unauthorized password policy queries."
  - "Restrict LDAP and PowerShell access to password policy attributes."
  - "Investigate querying account and context."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if password policy queries are part of normal admin tasks."
  - "Monitor for subsequent credential attacks."
  - "Recommend limiting password policy visibility where possible."
