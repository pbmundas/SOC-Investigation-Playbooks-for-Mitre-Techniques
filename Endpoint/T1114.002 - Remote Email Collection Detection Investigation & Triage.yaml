tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1114.002"
technique_name: "Remote Email Collection"
description: >
  Detects adversaries collecting email data remotely via email protocols or API access to mail servers.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Unusual Remote Access to Mail Servers"
    description: >
      Identify anomalous or unauthorized connections to mail servers via protocols like IMAP, POP3, or Exchange Web Services (EWS).
    checklist:
      - "Are there failed or suspicious login attempts on mail servers?"
      - "Is there access from unusual IPs or geolocations?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Mail server access logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Email Collection APIs or Commands"
    description: >
      Monitor API calls or commands that enumerate or export mailbox content.
    checklist:
      - "Are API calls used to export mailbox data?"
      - "Are PowerShell or other scripts performing mailbox exports remotely?"
    data_sources:
      - "API logs"
      - "PowerShell logging"
      - "Command execution logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Remote Email Access with Data Exfiltration"
    description: >
      Detect outbound data transfers or email forwarding consistent with data theft.
    checklist:
      - "Is data sent to external addresses?"
      - "Are there large volume downloads of mailbox content?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network traffic monitoring"
      - "Email gateway logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized remote email access."
      - "Medium: Suspicious remote mailbox access."
      - "High: Malicious remote email collection and exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized mailbox access and data theft."
      - "Medium: Suspicious remote API usage."
      - "Low: Routine remote access."

ioc_types:
  - "Suspicious IMAP/POP3/Exchange logins"
  - "Mailbox export commands or API usage"
  - "Outbound data transfers consistent with mailbox data"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Suspicious IMAP or POP3 Logins"

      auth.status = "failed" OR
      source.ip NOT IN (trusted_networks)

  - name: "Detect Exchange Web Services Mailbox Exports"
    query: >
      process.command_line CONTAINS ("Export-Mailbox", "Get-Mailbox")
