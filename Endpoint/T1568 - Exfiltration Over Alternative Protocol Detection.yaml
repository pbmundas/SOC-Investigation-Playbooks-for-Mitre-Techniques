playbook_name: "T1568 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol Detection"
tactic: "Exfiltration"
technique_id: "T1568"
technique_name: "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol"
description: >
  Detect adversaries exfiltrating data using non-standard or alternative network protocols.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Network Traffic for Unusual Protocol Usage"
    description: >
      Identify traffic using protocols uncommon in the environment or those not typically used for data transfer.
    checklist:
      - "Are there spikes in traffic on rarely used protocols or ports?"
      - "Is data being sent over protocols such as ICMP, FTP, or DNS unusually?"
      - "Are there outbound connections to suspicious destinations?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network flow logs"
      - "Firewall logs"
      - "IDS/IPS logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Packet Payloads and Sizes"
    description: >
      Inspect payloads for signs of data exfiltration, such as encoded or compressed data.
    checklist:
      - "Are payloads unusually large or frequent for the protocol?"
      - "Is there evidence of encoded or encrypted data in payloads?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network packet captures"
      - "Network analysis tools"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Endpoint and User Activity"
    description: >
      Determine if the exfiltration coincides with suspicious endpoint or user behaviors.
    checklist:
      - "Are processes creating large volumes of data prior to exfiltration?"
      - "Is user activity anomalous or outside business hours?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "User activity logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate use of alternative protocols."
      - "Medium: Suspicious traffic patterns."
      - "High: Confirmed data exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Payload or IOC match."
      - "Medium: Behavioral anomalies."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Unusual protocol usage"
  - "Suspicious destination IPs or domains"
  - "Encoded or encrypted payloads"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Large ICMP Packets Outbound"
    query: >
      icmp.type = 8 AND
      icmp.packet_size > threshold

  - name: "Detect DNS Requests with Suspiciously Large Payloads"
    query: >
      dns.query_type = "TXT" AND
      dns.response_size > threshold

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unusual protocol exfiltration attempts."
  - "Block suspicious outbound traffic."
  - "Trigger endpoint forensic analysis."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if alternative protocol use is authorized."
  - "Investigate endpoint processes tied to exfiltration."
  - "Coordinate with network and security teams for mitigation."
