playbook_name: "T1547.007 - Security Support Provider Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1547.007"
technique_name: "Security Support Provider"
description: >
  Detect adversaries who install or modify Security Support Providers (SSPs) to persist by hooking into authentication processes.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor SSP DLLs and Registry Entries"
    description: >
      Detect new or changed SSP DLLs registered in the registry.
    checklist:
      - "Are SSP DLLs added or modified under HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders?"
      - "Are DLLs signed and trusted?"
      - "Are file hashes flagged as malicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "Registry monitoring"
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Loading of SSP DLLs"
    description: >
      Observe loading of SSP DLLs in authentication processes.
    checklist:
      - "Are unauthorized DLLs loaded by lsass.exe or other auth processes?"
      - "Is there abnormal process behavior associated?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process and DLL load monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Authentication Anomalies"
    description: >
      Investigate authentication events for anomalies coinciding with SSP changes.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual logon failures or successes?"
      - "Are user privilege changes observed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Security Event Logs"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate Legitimate Changes"
    description: >
      Confirm if SSP changes are authorized or related to software updates.
    checklist:
      - "Is the DLL from a trusted vendor?"
      - "Is there patch or update documentation?"
    data_sources:
      - "Patch/change management"
      - "Threat intelligence"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Known and authorized SSP DLLs."
      - "Medium: Suspicious DLLs but unconfirmed impact."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious SSP DLL detected."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known malicious SSP DLL hashes."
      - "Medium: Unsigned or unusual DLL but no clear impact."
      - "Low: Known benign DLL."

ioc_types:
  - "SSP DLL file hashes"
  - "Registry SSP keys"
  - "Process DLL load events"
  - "Authentication event anomalies"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Registry Changes to SSP Keys"
    query: >
      registry.path:"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders" AND
      event.action:("registry_value_set" OR "registry_key_created")
  - name: "SSP DLL Loads in Authentication Processes"
    query: >
      process.name:"lsass.exe" AND
      dll.load.name:NOT("msv1_0.dll" OR "wdigest.dll" OR "kerberos.dll")
  - name: "Authentication Event Anomalies"
    query: >
      event.id:(4624 OR 4625) AND
      user.account.anomaly:true

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious SSP registry modifications."
  - "Block unauthorized SSP DLL loads."
  - "Quarantine suspicious DLL files."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify digital signatures and file origins."
  - "Correlate authentication anomalies with SSP changes."
  - "Consult threat intelligence."
  - "Engage incident response for confirmed detections."
