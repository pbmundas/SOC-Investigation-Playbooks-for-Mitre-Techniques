tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1636"
technique_name: "Email Collection"
description: >
  Detect and investigate adversaries collecting emails via automated tools, scripts, or manual techniques to gather sensitive communications.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Suspicious Email Client or Automation Executions"
    description: >
      Detect execution of tools or scripts that access or export email data.
    checklist:
      - "Are there processes launching email clients or scripting tools abnormally?"
      - "Are known email harvesting tools or scripts detected?"
      - "Is there access to mail database files or export of PST/OST files?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process execution logs"
      - "File access monitoring"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Unusual Email File Access or Exfiltration"
    description: >
      Monitor access or copying of mailbox files or exports.
    checklist:
      - "Are mailbox files (PST, OST) accessed outside business hours or by unusual users?"
      - "Is there evidence of file transfers or uploads of mail data?"
      - "Are there anomalous volumes of email data read or copied?"
    data_sources:
      - "File integrity and access logs"
      - "Network data exfiltration monitoring"
      - "SIEM alerts"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with User and Network Anomalies"
    description: >
      Identify unusual user behavior or network connections coinciding with email collection.
    checklist:
      - "Are users accessing email systems atypically?"
      - "Is there network traffic to suspicious destinations?"
      - "Are there alerts for credential misuse?"
    data_sources:
      - "User activity logs"
      - "Network monitoring"
      - "Threat intelligence"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate or Contain Incident"
    description: >
      Determine if activity is legitimate or malicious; take containment actions if needed.
    checklist:
      - "Is the activity part of authorized data export or backup?"
      - "Is immediate remediation or user lockdown required?"
    data_sources:
      - "Incident response platform"
      - "Asset and user management"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized email export or maintenance."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed email access."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious email collection."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known tool or confirmed exfiltration."
      - "Medium: Indicators of suspicious behavior."
      - "Low: Possibly benign or unknown."

ioc_types:
  - "Processes related to email clients or harvesting tools"
  - "Access to PST, OST, or mail database files"
  - "Unusual file copy or network upload events"
  - "User behavioral anomalies"
