playbook_name: "T1204 - User Execution Detection"
tactic: "Execution"
technique_id: "T1204"
technique_name: "User Execution"
description: >
  This playbook guides SOC analysts through detection and investigation of scenarios where a user executes
  a malicious file, script, or macro, resulting in adversary code execution. It includes file executions
  from email attachments, downloads, or removable media.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Review the Triggering Event"
    description: >
      Determine what file or script was executed and who executed it.
    checklist:
      - "What is the filename and extension?"
      - "Which user executed it?"
      - "What process was spawned as a result?"
      - "What was the parent process (e.g., Outlook, browser)?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR process tree"
      - "File execution logs (Sysmon Event ID 1)"
      - "Email security logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Determine the Execution Vector"
    description: >
      Understand how the file/script was introducedâ€”via email, download, USB, or network share.
    checklist:
      - "Did the file originate from email?"
      - "Was the source a browser or USB device?"
      - "Does it have Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) flag set?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Defender ATP or EDR"
      - "Mail gateway logs (e.g., Proofpoint, O365 ATP)"
      - "USB device logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Analyze Child Process Activity"
    description: >
      Investigate what processes were spawned after execution.
    checklist:
      - "Was PowerShell, cmd, or mshta launched?"
      - "Were LOLBins (e.g., regsvr32, rundll32) used?"
      - "Any network connections or dropped files?"
    data_sources:
      - "Sysmon (Event ID 1, 3, 11)"
      - "EDR telemetry"
      - "Process command line and parent/child relationships"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Check for Persistence or Malware Delivery"
    description: >
      Determine if malware was installed or persistence established.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new autoruns or scheduled tasks?"
      - "Did malware get dropped to disk?"
      - "Were registry keys modified?"
    data_sources:
      - "Autoruns / Windows Registry Logs"
      - "Scheduled Tasks (Event ID 4698)"
      - "Antivirus or malware detection alerts"

  - step_number: 5
    title: "Correlate with User Behavior"
    description: >
      Determine if the user behavior was suspicious or unintentional.
    checklist:
      - "Was the user tricked (social engineering)?"
      - "Is this behavior consistent with past actions?"
      - "Is there evidence of phishing email or impersonation?"
    data_sources:
      - "Email headers and body content"
      - "User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)"
      - "User profile baselines"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Non-malicious script executed by user"
      - "Medium: Suspicious document launched PowerShell"
      - "High: Executed file spawned network activity or persistent malware"
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Execution of known malware or LOLBin activity"
      - "Medium: Execution of unsigned/untrusted file with suspicious behavior"
      - "Low: New/unfamiliar file type execution"

ioc_types:
  - "File Hash (MD5/SHA256)"
  - "Command line arguments"
  - "Executable name"
  - "Email subject/sender"
  - "Registry changes"
  - "Dropped file names"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Suspicious Document Execution"
    query: >
      EventID=1 AND ParentImage="*winword.exe" AND (Image="*powershell.exe" OR Image="*cmd.exe")

  - name: "Executable from Download Folder"
    query: >
      FilePath="C:\\Users\\*\\Downloads\\*.exe" AND NOT VerifiedSigner="Microsoft Windows"

  - name: "Execution with Mark-of-the-Web"
    query: >
      File created with MOTW AND executed within 5 minutes by user

automation_hooks:
  - "Run VirusTotal/Hybrid Analysis scan on executed file hash"
  - "Trigger EDR full scan on involved host"
  - "Isolate endpoint if confirmed malicious activity"
  - "Extract original email from mail gateway for phishing analysis"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Check file reputation with AV, sandbox, and threat intel"
  - "Examine command-line arguments for obfuscation or red flags"
  - "Look for follow-on activity like credential access or lateral movement"
  - "Advise user on phishing awareness if accidental execution occurred"
