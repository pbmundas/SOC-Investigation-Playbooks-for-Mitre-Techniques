technique_name: "Account Discovery: Cloud Account"
description: >
  Detect enumeration of AWS IAM users, roles, and inline/attached policies using API calls 
  like `ListUsers`, `ListRoles`, `GetUser`, and `ListPolicies`. This is often an early-stage step 
  by attackers to understand privilege boundaries or identify targets for privilege escalation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Burst of IAM Enumeration API Calls"
    description: >
      Monitor for patterns of multiple IAM list and get operations in a short window by a single identity or access key.
    checklist:
      - "Are `ListUsers`, `ListRoles`, `ListAttachedUserPolicies` called in quick succession?"
      - "Is this identity part of a known automation/script?"
      - "Has the user/account shown enumeration behavior before?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "IAM Access Analyzer"
      - "GuardDuty (Policy: Credential Access via Enumeration)"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate Enumeration to New/Unknown Principals"
    description: >
      Identify if this behavior is tied to compromised credentials, external actors, or rogue automation.
    checklist:
      - "Was the activity from an unexpected IP or new device?"
      - "Was this access pattern seen on newly created credentials?"
      - "Are there IAM permission changes shortly after enumeration?"
    data_sources:
      - "VPC Flow Logs"
      - "AWS Config"
      - "IAM Credential Reports"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Admin script usage for inventory."
      - "Medium: Unusual enumeration from developer role."
      - "High: Enumeration followed by privilege escalation."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Access from external/untrusted location."
      - "Medium: Burst pattern from internal identity."
      - "Low: Background enumeration noise from known tool."

ioc_types:
  - "IAM ListUsers, ListRoles, GetUser API usage"
  - "Burst API calls within seconds by same principal"
  - "IP address not previously used by IAM principal"

queries/examples:
  - name: "IAM Enumeration Activity"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventName IN (ListUsers, ListRoles, GetUser, ListPolicies) AND userAgent != "AWSConsole"
  - name: "IAM Enumeration Burst Detection"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventSource="iam.amazonaws.com" AND count(eventName) > 5 IN 1min BY accessKeyId

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on IAM enumeration from new region or IP."
  - "Trigger automated tagging of suspicious access keys."
  - "Send IAM diff report to SOC with permissions granted."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Correlate enumeration with follow-on privilege or persistence actions."
  - "Evaluate contextâ€”was the user recently onboarded or part of a pentest?"
  - "Look for new roles, attached policies, or tokens post-enumeration."
