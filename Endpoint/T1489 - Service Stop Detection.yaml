playbook_name: "T1489 - Service Stop Detection"
tactic: "Impact"
technique_id: "T1489"
technique_name: "Service Stop"
description: >
  Detect adversaries stopping services to render systems or software inoperable during attacks (e.g., to disable security tools or ensure ransomware impact).

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Service Stop Events"
    description: >
      Monitor for suspicious stoppage of critical system or security services.
    checklist:
      - "Are security services (e.g., AV, EDR, firewall) stopped?"
      - "Are backup or logging services disabled?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Event Logs (System - Event ID 7036/7040)"
      - "Sysmon (Event ID 4)"
      - "Service Control Manager logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate with Process and User Context"
    description: >
      Investigate what initiated the service stop and who executed it.
    checklist:
      - "Was the stop issued by an unexpected user or process?"
      - "Was it followed by ransomware or credential access behaviors?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR logs"
      - "Command-line audit logs"
      - "Security alerts timeline"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Check for Automation or Scripting"
    description: >
      Determine if service stoppage was part of a script or scheduled task.
    checklist:
      - "Do you see use of `sc.exe`, `net stop`, or PowerShell `Stop-Service`?"
      - "Are stoppages repeated or batch-based?"
    data_sources:
      - "Command-line auditing (4688)"
      - "Script block logging"
      - "Task Scheduler logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "High: Critical security service stopped."
      - "Medium: Known service unexpectedly disabled."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Stoppage linked to malicious process/user."
      - "Medium: Suspicious behavior, not confirmed."

ioc_types:
  - "Use of net stop/sc.exe targeting security tools"
  - "Service stop followed by encryption or credential access"
  - "Non-admin users stopping services"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Suspicious Service Stop via sc.exe"
    query: >
      process.name:("sc.exe") AND command_line:("stop") AND service_name:("*av*", "*defender*", "*backup*")

  - name: "Windows Event ID 7036 for Service Stoppage"
    query: >
      event.code:7036 AND message:"service entered the stopped state" AND service_name:("Windows Defender", "VSS", "Sysmon")

automation_hooks:
  - "Isolate host via EDR"
  - "Trigger incident response workflow"
  - "Notify security operations and backup teams"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Check for ransomware indicators if security services were stopped."
  - "Correlate with log deletion or encryption activity (T1070, T1486)."
  - "Investigate host timeline for prior privilege escalation."
