playbook_name: "T1078.004 - Federated User/Role Creation: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1078.004"
technique_name: "Valid Accounts - Federated User/Role Creation"
description: >
  Detect creation or modification of federated users or roles that enable external identity providers to access AWS resources, potentially used by attackers for persistence or privilege escalation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Creation or Modification of Federated Roles"
    description: >
      Monitor CloudTrail for CreateRole, UpdateAssumeRolePolicy, or similar events involving federated roles.
    checklist:
      - "Are new roles created with trust policies allowing external IdPs?"
      - "Are existing roles' trust policies modified to add federated entities?"
      - "Is creation/modification activity performed by authorized administrators?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail (CreateRole, UpdateAssumeRolePolicy)"
      - "AWS IAM role trust policy logs"
      - "AWS Config"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Review Federated Role Permissions"
    description: >
      Evaluate the permissions granted to federated roles.
    checklist:
      - "Do federated roles have excessive or administrator-level permissions?"
      - "Are policies inline or attached managed policies?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS IAM policies"
      - "CloudTrail policy-related API calls"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Monitor Usage of Federated Roles"
    description: >
      Investigate the usage of federated roles for suspicious activity.
    checklist:
      - "Are federated roles assumed from unusual IPs or geographies?"
      - "Is there unusual frequency or timing of role assumption?"
      - "Is role assumption followed by privilege escalation or data access?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail (AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity)"
      - "AWS CloudWatch Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized federated role creation/modification."
      - "Medium: Suspicious changes requiring validation."
      - "High: Unauthorized creation or modification with suspicious usage."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Federated role created/modified by unknown user and suspicious usage."
      - "Medium: Unexpected modifications from known users."
      - "Low: Possible false positives from routine changes."

ioc_types:
  - "CreateRole with federated trust policy"
  - "UpdateAssumeRolePolicy adding federated principals"
  - "AssumeRoleWithSAML or AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity calls"
