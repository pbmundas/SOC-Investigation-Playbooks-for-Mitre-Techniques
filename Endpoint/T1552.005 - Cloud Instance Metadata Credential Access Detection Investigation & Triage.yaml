playbook_name: "T1552.005 - Cloud Instance Metadata Credential Access Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1552.005"
technique_name: "Cloud Instance Metadata Credential Access"
description: >
  Detects adversaries querying cloud instance metadata services to obtain temporary credentials or sensitive data.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access to Cloud Metadata Endpoints"
    description: >
      Detect HTTP requests to cloud instance metadata service URLs (e.g., AWS http://169.254.169.254).
    checklist:
      - "Are there requests to metadata endpoints from unexpected sources or processes?"
      - "Is the request timing or frequency suspicious?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network proxy/logs"
      - "Host-based HTTP request logs"
      - "Cloud provider logs (CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs)"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Metadata API Response Usage"
    description: >
      Determine if returned metadata (IAM roles, tokens, SSH keys) is being accessed or used for authentication.
    checklist:
      - "Are temporary credentials obtained from metadata used in subsequent API calls?"
      - "Are there lateral movement or unusual API requests?"
    data_sources:
      - "Cloud API logs"
      - "Authentication logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious Process or User Behavior"
    description: >
      Link metadata access to suspicious processes, users, or containers.
    checklist:
      - "Is a non-standard process accessing metadata?"
      - "Are there anomalies in process behavior following metadata access?"
    data_sources:
      - "Host process logs"
      - "EDR telemetry"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Metadata access by known trusted processes."
      - "Medium: Unusual metadata queries from less common processes or users."
      - "High: Metadata access followed by credential use or lateral movement."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified credential theft via metadata."
      - "Medium: Access without clear usage."
      - "Low: Routine metadata access by cloud agents."

ioc_types:
  - "Requests to 169.254.169.254 or equivalent"
  - "Unusual process accessing cloud metadata endpoints"
  - "Use of temporary credentials shortly after metadata queries"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Metadata Service Access"
    query: >
      network.destination_ip == "169.254.169.254" AND
      http.request_method == "GET"

  - name: "Temporary Credential Use After Metadata Access"
    query: >
      cloud.api_call AND
      cloud.credentials_source == "metadata_service"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious metadata endpoint access."
  - "Block processes or containers with unauthorized metadata queries."
  - "Trigger rotation of exposed temporary credentials."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify legitimacy of metadata access requests."
  - "Review associated API call logs for misuse."
  - "Recommend use of Instance Metadata Service v2 (IMDSv2) for improved security."
