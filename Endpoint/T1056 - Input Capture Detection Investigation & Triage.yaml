playbook_name: "T1056 - Input Capture Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1056"
technique_name: "Input Capture"
description: >
  Detects adversaries capturing user inputs such as keystrokes, mouse movements, or clipboard data through keyloggers or screen scrapers.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Keylogger or Input Capture Tool Execution"
    description: >
      Identify processes known for input capture or keylogging capabilities.
    checklist:
      - "Are keylogger binaries or scripts executed unexpectedly?"
      - "Is there suspicious hooking of input APIs?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "API call monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor for Input Capture Artifacts"
    description: >
      Detect files or network connections associated with input logging, such as log files or outbound transmissions.
    checklist:
      - "Are keylogging log files created or accessed?"
      - "Is input data transmitted over the network?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Network traffic analysis"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Input Capture with Credential Access or Exfiltration"
    description: >
      Investigate if input capture activity is linked with attempts to steal credentials or exfiltrate data.
    checklist:
      - "Is there network traffic shortly after input capture events?"
      - "Are compromised credentials detected?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "Credential access monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Input capture tools used with user consent."
      - "Medium: Suspicious input capture without confirmed exfiltration."
      - "High: Malicious input capture linked to credential theft."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified keylogger or input capture activity with data exfiltration."
      - "Medium: Detection of suspicious input capture processes."
      - "Low: Legitimate use of input capture software."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of keylogger or input capture binaries"
  - "Creation or access of input log files"
  - "Suspicious network connections following input capture"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Keylogger Execution"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on execution of input capture tools by unauthorized users."
  - "Block suspicious network transmissions of input logs."
  - "Notify security operations for investigation."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify legitimacy of input capture activity."
  - "Examine user and process behavior."
  - "Check for related credential theft or lateral movement."
