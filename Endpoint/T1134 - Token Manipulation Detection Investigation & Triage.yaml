playbook_name: "T1134 - Token Manipulation Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Privilege Escalation"
technique_id: "T1134"
technique_name: "Token Manipulation"
description: >
  Detect and investigate token manipulation activities such as impersonation or token theft used by adversaries to escalate privileges or bypass access controls.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Access Token Operations"
    description: >
      Look for suspicious calls to DuplicateToken, OpenProcessToken, or AdjustTokenPrivileges APIs.
    checklist:
      - "Are high-privilege tokens accessed or duplicated?"
      - "Are low-privilege processes using elevated tokens?"
    data_sources:
      - "API telemetry"
      - "Process logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate Token Use With Anomalous Behavior"
    description: >
      Identify if elevated tokens are used by processes with unusual ancestry or behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Do token usages correlate with lateral movement or credential dumping?"
      - "Is there a mismatch between parent and child process privileges?"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR"
      - "SIEM alerts"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Analyze for Signs of Privilege Escalation"
    description: >
      Determine if manipulated tokens enabled unauthorized access or escalation.
    checklist:
      - "Did the token manipulation allow access to protected resources?"
      - "Was it followed by creation of admin-level sessions?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Process tree analysis"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Confirm and Contain"
    description: >
      Validate abuse and apply containment.
    checklist:
      - "Is the activity linked to known malware or threat actor?"
      - "Is containment or host isolation required?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence"
      - "IR response data"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Legitimate access by system tools."
      - "Medium: Unexpected token duplication in user sessions."
      - "High: Confirmed token misuse by malicious process."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known attacker behavior."
      - "Medium: Suspicious token access patterns."
      - "Low: Rare token activity but no impact."

ioc_types:
  - "Access token handle usage"
  - "Privilege escalation events"
  - "Token impersonation API calls"

queries/examples:
  - name: "DuplicateToken API Use"
    query: >
      api.call:DuplicateToken AND process.integrity_level:low
  - name: "Token Privileges Adjusted in Suspicious Context"
    query: >
      api.call:AdjustTokenPrivileges AND process.parent.name:cmd.exe

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on token manipulation APIs by non-system processes."
  - "Auto-tag suspicious token escalation sequences."
  - "Initiate IR workflow for token abuse."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Compare privileges before and after token manipulation."
  - "Check token lineage in context of session behavior."
  - "Validate with threat intel for known abuse techniques."
