playbook_name: "T1499 - Endpoint Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion Attacks on AWS Services)"
tactic: "Impact"
technique_id: "T1499"
technique_name: "Endpoint Denial of Service"
description: >
  Detect and investigate denial-of-service attacks targeting AWS services by exhausting resources,
  causing service disruption or degradation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor AWS Service Metrics for Resource Exhaustion"
    description: >
      Review CloudWatch metrics for unusual spikes in CPU, memory, network, or API request rates on EC2, Lambda, and other services.
    checklist:
      - "Are there sudden spikes in CPU or memory utilization on EC2 instances?"
      - "Are Lambda invocation errors or throttling increasing abnormally?"
      - "Are API request rates unusually high or spiking?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudWatch Metrics"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "VPC Flow Logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Unusual Traffic or API Patterns"
    description: >
      Detect repeated or malformed API calls or network traffic intended to exhaust service limits or cause degradation.
    checklist:
      - "Are there high volumes of identical API calls or requests?"
      - "Are there repeated requests from single or distributed IPs?"
      - "Are requests triggering rate limiting or throttling?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "VPC Flow Logs"
      - "API Gateway Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Potential Attack Vectors"
    description: >
      Investigate if the resource exhaustion is linked to compromised accounts, unusual user activity, or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Are there suspicious IAM user or role activities preceding the attack?"
      - "Is the traffic originating from known malicious IPs or regions?"
      - "Is there evidence of prior reconnaissance or persistence?"
    data_sources:
      - "IAM Logs"
      - "Threat Intelligence Feeds"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Transient or authorized high resource usage."
      - "Medium: Repeated spikes requiring validation."
      - "High: Confirmed DoS or resource exhaustion attack."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious resource exhaustion."
      - "Medium: Suspicious activity with inconclusive evidence."
      - "Low: Legitimate but unusual resource usage."

ioc_types:
  - "Sudden spikes in CloudWatch metrics"
  - "High frequency or repetitive API calls"
  - "Increased Lambda throttling or errors"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Spike in EC2 CPU Usage"
    query: >
      cloudwatch: namespace="AWS/EC2" metricName="CPUUtilization" statistic="Average" period=300 > 80
  - name: "High API Request Rate"
    query: >
      cloudtrail: eventSource="ec2.amazonaws.com" AND eventName IN ("DescribeInstances", "RunInstances") AND eventTime > last_1h | stats count() by sourceIPAddress
  - name: "Lambda Invocation Errors"
    query: >
      cloudwatch: namespace="AWS/Lambda" metricName="Errors" > 100

automation_hooks:
  - "Trigger auto-scaling or throttling policies on resource exhaustion."
  - "Alert on repeated or malformed API request patterns."
  - "Throttle or block IPs exceeding request thresholds."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if the high resource usage is business-related."
  - "Investigate source and context of traffic or API calls."
  - "Recommend implementing WAF, rate limiting, and resource quotas."
