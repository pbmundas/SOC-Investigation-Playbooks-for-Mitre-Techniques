playbook_name: "T1071.002 - File Transfer Protocols Command and Control Detection"
tactic: "Command and Control"
technique_id: "T1071.002"
technique_name: "File Transfer Protocols"
description: >
  Detect adversaries using FTP, SFTP, or similar file transfer protocols for command and control communication.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor FTP/SFTP Connections for Anomalies"
    description: >
      Identify unusual or unauthorized FTP/SFTP sessions to external IPs or domains.
    checklist:
      - "Are there FTP connections outside of business hours or to uncommon endpoints?"
      - "Is there a spike in FTP sessions or data transfer volume?"
    data_sources:
      - "FTP/SFTP server logs"
      - "Network flow logs"
      - "Firewall logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Known Malicious FTP Servers or Credentials"
    description: >
      Correlate FTP endpoints with threat intelligence for known malicious servers or compromised credentials.
    checklist:
      - "Is the FTP server IP or domain flagged as malicious?"
      - "Are there authentication attempts with unusual usernames?"
    data_sources:
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"
      - "FTP logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Identify Abnormal File Transfers Over FTP/SFTP"
    description: >
      Look for transfers of suspicious files or large volumes of data indicative of C2 or data exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Are executable or script files transferred?"
      - "Is data transfer size inconsistent with normal usage?"
    data_sources:
      - "File transfer logs"
      - "Network traffic analysis"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Routine FTP usage."
      - "Medium: Suspicious FTP activity."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious FTP-based C2 or data exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known malicious server or confirmed malicious file transfer."
      - "Medium: Anomalous FTP behavior."
      - "Low: Possible false positives from legitimate file transfers."

ioc_types:
  - "Malicious FTP server IPs or domains"
  - "Unusual FTP credentials or usernames"
  - "Suspicious files transferred via FTP/SFTP"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect FTP Connections to Malicious IPs"
    query: >
      ftp.destination_ip IN (malicious_ip_list) OR
      sftp.destination_ip IN (malicious_ip_list)

  - name: "Detect Large File Transfers via FTP Outside Business Hours"
    query: >
      ftp.bytes_transferred > threshold AND
      ftp.timestamp NOT IN (business_hours)

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious FTP/SFTP activity."
  - "Block connections to known malicious FTP servers."
  - "Notify SOC for investigation of suspicious file transfers."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if FTP activity aligns with business operations."
  - "Investigate user accounts used in FTP sessions."
  - "Check endpoint logs for related suspicious activity."
