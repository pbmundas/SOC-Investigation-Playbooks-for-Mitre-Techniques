playbook_name: "T1203 - Client Exploit Detection"
tactic: "Execution"
technique_id: "T1203"
technique_name: "Exploitation for Client Execution"
description: >
  Assists analysts in detecting exploitation attempts against client applications (e.g., browsers,
  document readers) to achieve code execution.

detection_sources:
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  - Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)
  - Application logs (e.g., browser crash reports)
  - Threat intelligence feeds for exploit CVEs

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Exploit Attempts"
    description: >
      Detect exploit activity by monitoring application crashes, suspicious payloads, or abnormal client behavior.
    checklist:
      - "Look for crashes or unusual termination of client apps"
      - "Monitor network traffic for exploit payload signatures"
      - "Correlate with threat intelligence on known exploits"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR telemetry"
      - "Network IDS"
      - "Application logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Investigate Endpoint Behavior"
    description: >
      Analyze endpoint processes for anomalous code execution.
    checklist:
      - "Check for spawned shells or suspicious child processes"
      - "Review PowerShell, cmd, or script execution post-exploit"
      - "Verify file creation or modification patterns"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR process and file logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Contain and Remediate"
    description: >
      Isolate affected endpoints and apply patches or mitigations.
    checklist:
      - "Isolate compromised systems"
      - "Apply patches to vulnerable clients"
      - "Run malware scans and forensics"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint management"
      - "Patch management"

triage_labels:
  - severity:
      - "Medium: Exploit attempt detected"
      - "High: Successful code execution"
  - confidence:
      - "High: Confirmed exploit payload"
      - "Medium: Suspicious client crashes"
