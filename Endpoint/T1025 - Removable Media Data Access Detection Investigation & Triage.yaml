playbook_name: "T1025 - Removable Media Data Access Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1025"
technique_name: "Removable Media Data Access"
description: >
  Detects adversaries accessing or copying sensitive data to removable media devices such as USB drives.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor USB or Removable Media Connection Events"
    description: >
      Identify when removable storage devices are connected to endpoints.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected or unauthorized USB devices connected?"
      - "Is there a correlation with sensitive data access following device connection?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint device logs"
      - "Windows event logs (Event ID 1006, 4663)"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect File Copy or Write Operations to Removable Media"
    description: >
      Detect file operations involving copying or moving files to removable devices.
    checklist:
      - "Are sensitive files copied to removable devices?"
      - "Is file copying activity occurring during unusual hours or by unusual users?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "USB device usage logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with User and Process Behavior"
    description: >
      Review processes and user accounts involved in removable media data access.
    checklist:
      - "Are known or authorized users performing the actions?"
      - "Is there any suspicious process involved?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "User behavior analytics"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized removable media use."
      - "Medium: Unusual removable media activity."
      - "High: Unauthorized copying of sensitive data to removable devices."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified sensitive data copied to removable media."
      - "Medium: Suspicious file activity on removable devices."
      - "Low: Benign removable media usage."

ioc_types:
  - "Removable media connected to endpoint"
  - "File write/copy operations to USB or external devices"
  - "Unusual user or process activity around device use"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Removable Media Connection"
    query: >
      event_id IN (1006, 4663) AND
      device.type = "removable"

  - name: "File Copy to Removable Device"
    query: >
      file.copy_operation = true AND
      destination.device.type = "removable"

automation_hooks:
  - "Generate alerts on unauthorized removable media connections."
  - "Block write access to removable devices for sensitive data."
  - "Notify security team immediately on suspicious activity."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if removable media use is authorized."
  - "Investigate user and process details."
  - "Implement policies to control removable media use."
