playbook_name: "T1550.001 - Pass the Hash Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1550.001"
technique_name: "Pass the Hash"
description: >
  Detects adversaries using stolen password hashes to authenticate without cracking them.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Use of NTLM or Other Hashes for Authentication"
    description: >
      Monitor authentication logs for NTLM or SMB logins using hashes instead of plaintext passwords.
    checklist:
      - "Are there logins using NTLM hashes from unusual sources?"
      - "Is there lateral movement with hash-based authentication?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network SMB traffic logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Suspicious Lateral Movement Patterns"
    description: >
      Look for sequences of authentication events consistent with Pass the Hash techniques.
    checklist:
      - "Are multiple systems accessed in a short time frame using hash-based auth?"
      - "Are elevated privileges obtained via hash authentication?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint logs"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Credential Theft Activity"
    description: >
      Check for prior credential dumping or hash theft on the source host.
    checklist:
      - "Was credential dumping observed before hash authentication?"
      - "Are there known hash dumping tools executed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection logs"
      - "Process execution logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Single isolated hash use without follow-up."
      - "Medium: Multiple lateral authentications with hashes."
      - "High: Confirmed lateral movement and privilege escalation via hashes."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified hash use and confirmed attack tools."
      - "Medium: Suspicious auth patterns with no full confirmation."
      - "Low: Possible false positives due to legitimate NTLM usage."

ioc_types:
  - "Authentication events using NTLM hashes"
  - "Credential dumping tool executions"
  - "Unusual lateral movement with elevated privileges"
