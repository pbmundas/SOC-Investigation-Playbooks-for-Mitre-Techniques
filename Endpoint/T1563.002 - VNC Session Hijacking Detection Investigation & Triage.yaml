playbook_name: "T1563.002 - VNC Session Hijacking Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1563.002"
technique_name: "VNC Session Hijacking"
description: >
  Detects adversaries hijacking active Virtual Network Computing (VNC) sessions to maintain unauthorized access or evade detection.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Active VNC Sessions"
    description: >
      Track VNC session connections, disconnections, and concurrent sessions to identify suspicious activities.
    checklist:
      - "Are there multiple connections from different users to the same VNC session?"
      - "Are there unexplained session disconnects or reconnects?"
    data_sources:
      - "VNC server logs"
      - "Network connection logs"
  
  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Anomalous VNC Client Activity"
    description: >
      Identify unusual VNC client IP addresses or device fingerprints connecting to sessions.
    checklist:
      - "Are connections coming from unusual IP addresses or geolocations?"
      - "Is there evidence of automated or scripted VNC access?"
    data_sources:
      - "VNC server logs"
      - "Network flow data"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Post-Hijack Malicious Actions"
    description: >
      Investigate any suspicious commands, privilege escalations, or lateral movement after hijacking.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of malicious commands or file transfers?"
      - "Are there new processes spawned by VNC sessions?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring logs"
      - "File access logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal VNC usage patterns."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but unconfirmed hijacking."
      - "High: Confirmed VNC session hijacking."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified session hijacking with malicious activity."
      - "Medium: Anomalous VNC session activity."
      - "Low: Legitimate but unusual VNC usage."

ioc_types:
  - "Multiple concurrent VNC connections to same session"
  - "VNC connections from anomalous IP addresses"
  - "Unexpected VNC session disconnections/reconnections"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Multiple VNC Connections"
    query: >
      vnc.session_id EXISTS AND
      count(vnc.connection) > 1 WITHIN 5 minutes

  - name: "Detect VNC Access from Unusual IPs"
    query: >
      vnc.connection_ip NOT IN known trusted IP list

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious VNC session activities."
  - "Force disconnect anomalous VNC sessions."
  - "Notify security team for further analysis."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate the legitimacy of VNC sessions and IP addresses."
  - "Investigate correlated post-session malicious activity."
  - "Recommend multi-factor authentication on VNC access."
