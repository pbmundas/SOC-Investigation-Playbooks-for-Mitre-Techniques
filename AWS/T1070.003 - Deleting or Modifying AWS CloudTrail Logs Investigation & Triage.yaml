playbook_name: "T1070.003 - Deleting or Modifying AWS CloudTrail Logs: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1070.003"
technique_name: "Clear Command History / Modify Logs"
description: >
  Detect deletion or tampering with AWS CloudTrail logs to cover attacker tracks or reduce visibility.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Log Deletion Events in S3 or CloudTrail"
    description: >
      Investigate `DeleteObject`, `DeleteBucket`, `StopLogging`, and `DeleteTrail` actions in CloudTrail and S3 logs.
    checklist:
      - "Is CloudTrail logging disabled or stopped?"
      - "Are log files deleted from S3 by unusual users?"
      - "Are there repeated `DeleteObject` calls targeting CloudTrail paths?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail logs"
      - "S3 access logs"
      - "VPC flow logs (for source context)"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate with Other Defense Evasion or Credential Access"
    description: >
      Cross-check for evidence of credential compromise, lateral movement, or privilege escalation.
    checklist:
      - "Did the user or role recently gain new privileges?"
      - "Was there suspicious IAM activity shortly before the deletion?"
      - "Were alarms or monitoring suppressed?"
    data_sources:
      - "IAM logs"
      - "SIEM detection rules"
      - "CloudTrail event correlation"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Validate Impact and Restore Log Visibility"
    description: >
      Determine if logs were permanently deleted or if versions exist.
    checklist:
      - "Are object versions or backups available?"
      - "Was versioning or MFA delete enabled for the log buckets?"
      - "Can deleted logs be restored from S3 Glacier or other retention tools?"
    data_sources:
      - "S3 bucket versioning metadata"
      - "Cloud backup tools"
      - "Retention and audit policies"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized log cleanup per lifecycle policy."
      - "Medium: Unusual IAM user action with unclear purpose."
      - "High: Malicious log deletion linked to compromise."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known malicious actor or compromise context."
      - "Medium: Suspected but not confirmed identity misuse."
      - "Low: Routine or test environment change."

ioc_types:
  - "DeleteTrail API activity"
  - "DeleteObject targeting CloudTrail S3 paths"
  - "StopLogging events"
