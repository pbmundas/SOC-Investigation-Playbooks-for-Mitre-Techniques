playbook_name: "T1563.001 - RDP Session Hijacking Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1563.001"
technique_name: "RDP Session Hijacking"
description: >
  Detects adversaries hijacking active Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions to maintain access or evade detection.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Active RDP Sessions"
    description: >
      Track session connection and disconnection events, looking for anomalies like multiple concurrent sessions or sudden session takeovers.
    checklist:
      - "Are there multiple logins from different accounts on the same session?"
      - "Are there unexpected session disconnections or reconnections?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows event logs (4624, 4778, 4779)"
      - "RDP session logs"
      - "Network connection logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Session Token Theft or Injection"
    description: >
      Identify use of stolen or duplicated session tokens that allow hijacking of active RDP sessions.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of token manipulation or impersonation?"
      - "Are there suspicious processes spawning in the context of RDP sessions?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring logs"
      - "Endpoint detection logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Hijacking with Malicious Actions"
    description: >
      Review activity post-hijacking for lateral movement, credential theft, or persistence.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unusual commands or data transfers in hijacked sessions?"
      - "Is there evidence of privilege escalation?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Routine RDP session activity."
      - "Medium: Suspicious session anomalies."
      - "High: Confirmed RDP session hijacking."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified token theft or session hijacking."
      - "Medium: Anomalous RDP session behavior."
      - "Low: Normal session fluctuations."

ioc_types:
  - "Multiple concurrent RDP sessions for same user"
  - "Token theft or impersonation events"
  - "Unexpected RDP session disconnections/reconnections"
