playbook_name: "T1070.004 - Command History Clearing Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1070.004"
technique_name: "Command History Clearing"
description: >
  Detect clearing or deletion of shell or command history to cover attacker tracks.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Clearing of Shell History Files"
    description: >
      Monitor deletion or truncation of history files like ~/.bash_history, ~/.zsh_history, or Windows PowerShell history.
    checklist:
      - "Are shell history files deleted or truncated?"
      - "Are suspicious commands executed before history clearing?"
    data_sources:
      - "Filesystem monitoring"
      - "Auditd or endpoint telemetry"
      - "PowerShell event logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Use of Commands to Clear History"
    description: >
      Identify commands such as 'history -c', 'rm ~/.bash_history', 'Clear-History' (PowerShell), or environment modifications disabling history.
    checklist:
      - "Are history clearing commands executed by unusual users/processes?"
      - "Are environment variables set to disable command logging?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process command line logs"
      - "Shell session monitoring"
      - "PowerShell logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious Activities"
    description: >
      Check if history clearing coincides with privilege escalation, malware execution, or lateral movement.
    checklist:
      - "Are history clearing events clustered with suspicious activity?"
      - "Are unusual user accounts involved?"
    data_sources:
      - "SIEM correlation"
      - "Endpoint detection"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Response and Recovery"
    description: >
      Investigate the scope, recover command logs if possible, and harden systems against future clearing.
    checklist:
      - "Restore history files from backups or monitoring logs."
      - "Implement shell logging enhancements."
    data_sources:
      - "Backup and monitoring tools"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized clearing or maintenance."
      - "Medium: Unexplained clearing requiring investigation."
      - "High: Unauthorized or malicious history clearing."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed history clearing by unauthorized user."
      - "Medium: Suspicious but incomplete evidence."
      - "Low: Benign clearing or user action."

ioc_types:
  - "Deletion/truncation of shell history files"
  - "History clearing commands (e.g. history -c, Clear-History)"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect bash history file deletion"
    query: >
      file.name:.bash_history AND event.action:deleted
  - name: "PowerShell Clear-History usage"
    query: >
      process.command_line:*Clear-History*

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on deletion/truncation of history files."
  - "Trigger investigation workflow on Clear-History commands."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Confirm if history clearing was scheduled or authorized."
  - "Look for related malicious activity."
  - "Engage incident response if unauthorized."
