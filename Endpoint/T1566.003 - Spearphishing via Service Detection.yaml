tactic: "Initial Access"
technique_id: "T1566.003"
technique_name: "Spearphishing via Service"
description: >
  Guides SOC analysts through detecting spearphishing attempts that exploit services (e.g., chat,
  collaboration, or social media platforms) to deliver malicious links or files for initial access.

detection_sources:
  - Collaboration platform logs (Slack, Teams, Discord)
  - Email gateway logs (for related emails)
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  - SIEM alerts on suspicious file or link sharing
  - Threat intelligence platforms

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Suspicious Messages or Files"
    description: >
      Review logs for messages or files shared on collaboration platforms that contain suspicious links or attachments.
    checklist:
      - "Check sender reputation and account history"
      - "Extract and analyze URLs or file hashes"
      - "Look for known malicious indicators or unusual sharing patterns"
    data_sources:
      - "Collaboration platform audit logs"
      - "Threat intelligence feeds"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Endpoint Activity"
    description: >
      Investigate if recipients have interacted with suspicious links/files and check for compromise.
    checklist:
      - "Correlate with endpoint process creation and network activity"
      - "Review EDR alerts for suspicious execution or persistence"
    data_sources:
      - "EDR telemetry"
      - "Network logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Containment"
    description: >
      Block malicious content and isolate affected systems.
    checklist:
      - "Restrict or disable compromised accounts"
      - "Block malicious URLs or file hashes in endpoint and network security"
      - "Notify impacted users"
    data_sources:
      - "Collaboration platform management console"
      - "Endpoint management tools"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "User Awareness"
    description: >
      Communicate with users about the spearphishing attempt and educate on spotting suspicious messages.
    checklist:
      - "Send awareness notifications"
      - "Encourage reporting of suspicious messages"
    data_sources:
      - "Security awareness platform"

triage_labels:
  - severity:
      - "Low: Suspicious message detected, no interaction"
      - "Medium: User interaction without further compromise"
      - "High: Confirmed compromise or execution"
  - confidence:
      - "High: Known malicious indicators found"
      - "Medium: Suspicious but inconclusive"
      - "Low: Possible false positive"
