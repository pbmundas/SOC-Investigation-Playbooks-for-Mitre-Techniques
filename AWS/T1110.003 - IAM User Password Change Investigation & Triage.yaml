tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1110.003"
technique_name: "IAM User Password Change"
description: >
  Detect changes to IAM user passwords which could indicate account takeover attempts or attacker persistence.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor IAM Password Change Events"
    description: >
      Track API calls that change or reset IAM user passwords such as UpdateLoginProfile.
    checklist:
      - "Are passwords changed without prior approval?"
      - "Is the change initiated by authorized administrators?"
      - "Are changes happening during unusual hours?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail (UpdateLoginProfile)"
      - "AWS Config"
      - "IAM Credential Reports"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Review Context of Password Changes"
    description: >
      Analyze the source IP, user agent, and user who performed the password change.
    checklist:
      - "Is the request coming from a known IP or location?"
      - "Is the initiating user legitimate and expected to perform this action?"
      - "Are there multiple password changes within a short timeframe?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail logs"
      - "Authentication logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Subsequent Access Attempts"
    description: >
      Check for successful logins or API calls following password changes.
    checklist:
      - "Is there immediate suspicious login after password change?"
      - "Are there changes to other user permissions or policies?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "Authentication logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized password change."
      - "Medium: Unexpected password changes needing validation."
      - "High: Unauthorized password change with suspicious access."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Password change followed by suspicious activity."
      - "Medium: Unusual change without immediate suspicious activity."
      - "Low: Routine password rotation or admin activity."

ioc_types:
  - "UpdateLoginProfile API calls"
  - "Multiple password changes from same user/IP"
  - "Suspicious login following password change"
