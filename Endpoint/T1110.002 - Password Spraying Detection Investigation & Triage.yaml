playbook_name: "T1110.002 - Password Spraying Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1110.002"
technique_name: "Password Spraying"
description: >
  Detects attempts to gain access by trying a few commonly used passwords against many accounts to avoid lockouts.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Failed Logins with Common Passwords Across Many Accounts"
    description: >
      Identify authentication failures where the same password is tried against multiple accounts.
    checklist:
      - "Are multiple accounts experiencing failed login attempts using common passwords?"
      - "Is the failure pattern spread over many user accounts but limited attempts per account?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "SIEM correlation rules"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate Source IP and Timing Patterns"
    description: >
      Analyze if the attempts originate from the same IP or small set of IPs and are spread over time to evade detection.
    checklist:
      - "Are there repeated login attempts with common passwords from the same IP?"
      - "Is the login attempt pattern slow and distributed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Firewall logs"
      - "Network traffic logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Check for Successful Logins Post Spraying"
    description: >
      Verify if any account is successfully accessed after password spraying attempts.
    checklist:
      - "Are there successful logins from the suspicious IPs or accounts?"
      - "Is the post-login activity abnormal?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "User behavior analytics"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: No successful logins and low attempt frequency."
      - "Medium: Multiple failed attempts across many accounts."
      - "High: Successful login after password spraying attempts."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed use of common passwords across accounts."
      - "Medium: Suspicious failed login pattern."
      - "Low: Isolated failed login attempts."

ioc_types:
  - "Repeated failed logins using common passwords"
  - "Same IP targeting many user accounts"
  - "Successful login after spraying attempts"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Password Spraying Attempts"
    query: >
      event.type == "authentication_failure" AND
      password IN ("Password123", "Welcome1", "Summer2025") AND
      count(distinct user.name) BY source.ip WITHIN 1 hour > 10

  - name: "Successful Login After Password Spraying"
    query: >
      event.type == "authentication_success" AND
      previous_events(event.type == "authentication_failure" AND password IN ("Password123", "Welcome1")) > 5 WITHIN 1 hour

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on password spraying patterns."
  - "Throttle or block IPs performing spraying."
  - "Force MFA and password reset for targeted accounts."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review commonly used passwords in your environment."
  - "Monitor for accounts targeted by spraying."
  - "Enhance password policies and implement MFA."
