playbook_name: "T1547.002 - Authentication Package Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1547.002"
technique_name: "Authentication Package"
description: >
  Detect adversaries who install or modify authentication packages (DLLs) to maintain persistence during the authentication process.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Changes to Authentication Packages"
    description: >
      Monitor for new or modified DLLs in authentication package locations (e.g., %SystemRoot%\\System32\\).
    checklist:
      - "Are there DLLs newly added or modified in authentication package folders?"
      - "Are any DLLs digitally unsigned or modified recently?"
      - "Is there a mismatch with known baseline DLLs?"
    data_sources:
      - "File integrity monitoring"
      - "Windows event logs (System and Security)"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Injection or Loading of Malicious Authentication DLLs"
    description: >
      Monitor processes for loading unusual or unauthorized authentication packages.
    checklist:
      - "Are authentication processes loading non-standard DLLs?"
      - "Are there suspicious parent-child process chains?"
      - "Is there any abnormal process behavior associated?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation and image load logs"
      - "DLL load tracing"
      - "EDR telemetry"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Authentication Failures or Anomalies"
    description: >
      Investigate suspicious authentication events around the time of DLL changes.
    checklist:
      - "Are there abnormal authentication failures or successes?"
      - "Are user login patterns or behaviors unusual?"
      - "Is there evidence of lateral movement or privilege escalation?"
    data_sources:
      - "Windows Security Event Logs (4624, 4625, 4648)"
      - "Authentication system logs"
      - "SIEM correlation"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Validate Legitimacy of Changes"
    description: >
      Confirm if DLL changes or loading are authorized.
    checklist:
      - "Is the DLL signed by a trusted vendor?"
      - "Is there a recent patch or update explaining the change?"
      - "Are endpoint protections and AV active and updated?"
    data_sources:
      - "Patch management"
      - "Threat intelligence"
      - "EDR status"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized DLL updates or patches."
      - "Medium: Unverified DLL changes."
      - "High: Malicious authentication package detected."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known malware or suspicious DLL hash."
      - "Medium: Unsigned or anomalous DLL but no clear impact."
      - "Low: Known benign updates."

ioc_types:
  - "DLL file hashes"
  - "File modification timestamps"
  - "Process DLL load events"
  - "Authentication event anomalies"

queries/examples:
  - name: "New or Modified DLLs in Authentication Package Folder"
    query: >
      file.path:"C:\\Windows\\System32\\*.dll" AND
      event.action:("file_created" OR "file_modified")
  - name: "Processes Loading Unusual Authentication DLLs"
    query: >
      process.name:"lsass.exe" AND
      dll.load.name:NOT("authpkg.dll" OR "msv1_0.dll" OR "wdigest.dll")
  - name: "Authentication Failures Near DLL Modifications"
    query: >
      event.id:(4625 OR 4648) AND
      timestamp:[now-1h TO now]

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on unsigned or suspicious DLLs in authentication package directories"
  - "Block unauthorized DLL loads in authentication processes"
  - "Quarantine suspicious DLL files"

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify file signatures and origin."
  - "Review authentication event anomalies."
  - "Check for associated process or network anomalies."
  - "Consult threat intel for known malicious DLLs."
