playbook_name: "T1074.002 - Remote Data Staging Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1074.002"
technique_name: "Remote Data Staging"
description: >
  Detects adversaries staging data on remote systems such as shared drives or external hosts before exfiltration.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor File Writes to Remote Locations"
    description: >
      Detect file creation or modification on remote network shares or external hosts.
    checklist:
      - "Are large files or archives being created on remote shares?"
      - "Is there unusual access by user accounts or hosts to remote shares?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network file share logs"
      - "Endpoint file system monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Bulk Data Upload or Transfer"
    description: >
      Identify mass file copy or movement from local to remote locations.
    checklist:
      - "Are there large-scale copy operations to remote shares?"
      - "Are transfers occurring during off-hours or by unusual users?"
    data_sources:
      - "File server access logs"
      - "Network transfer monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Remote Staging with Exfiltration Activity"
    description: >
      Determine if data staged remotely is then moved outside the environment.
    checklist:
      - "Is remote data staging followed by external data transfers?"
      - "Are involved systems or accounts linked to prior compromise?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "SIEM correlation alerts"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized remote file operations."
      - "Medium: Unusual remote data staging detected."
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized remote data staging."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified malicious remote staging followed by exfiltration."
      - "Medium: Suspicious remote file operations without full context."
      - "Low: Known remote backup or sync activities."

ioc_types:
  - "Large file creation on remote network shares"
  - "Bulk file transfer from local to remote hosts"
  - "Unusual user or host access to remote storage"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Large File Writes to Remote Shares"
    query: >
      file.path STARTS_WITH ("\\\\network_share\\") AND
      file.size > 100MB AND
      file.creation_time > now() - 1h

  - name: "Bulk File Copy to Remote Host"
    query: >
      process.name IN ("robocopy.exe", "scp", "rsync") AND
      file.copy_count > 50 WITHIN 30 minutes

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious remote file staging."
  - "Restrict remote write access on sensitive shares."
  - "Notify incident response for rapid containment."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if remote staging activity is part of authorized operations."
  - "Investigate any associated exfiltration or lateral movement."
  - "Enforce access control and audit policies on remote shares."
