playbook_name: "T1003.005 - Cached Credentials Dumping Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1003.005"
technique_name: "Cached Credentials"
description: >
  Detect attempts to dump cached credentials (e.g., NTLM hashes) stored on Windows systems, often targeted to reuse credentials offline.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Detect Access to Cached Credentials Storage"
    description: >
      Monitor for suspicious access or dumping of cached credentials from system files or registry.
    checklist:
      - "Are there processes accessing files like %SystemRoot%\\System32\\config\\SECURITY or registry keys?"
      - "Is there execution of tools known to extract cached credentials?"
    data_sources:
      - "File access logs"
      - "Registry access logs"
      - "Process creation logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Credential Dumping Tools Usage"
    description: >
      Detect known utilities such as Mimikatz dumping cached credentials.
    checklist:
      - "Is Mimikatz or similar tool executed with cached credentials modules?"
      - "Are suspicious PowerShell or script activities targeting cached credentials?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process monitoring"
      - "Command-line arguments"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious Authentication or Movement"
    description: >
      Look for unusual network authentication or lateral movement using dumped cached credentials.
    checklist:
      - "Are there logins from unusual accounts or machines?"
      - "Is there evidence of Pass-the-Hash or replay attacks?"
    data_sources:
      - "Authentication logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Routine maintenance or backups."
      - "Medium: Suspicious access without confirmed dump."
      - "High: Confirmed cached credentials dumping."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known tool execution with cached credentials extraction."
      - "Medium: Suspicious file or registry access."
      - "Low: Possible false positives."

ioc_types:
  - "Access to SECURITY registry or system files"
  - "Execution of credential dumping tools targeting cached creds"
  - "Suspicious authentication attempts"
