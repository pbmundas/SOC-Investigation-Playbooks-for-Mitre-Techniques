playbook_name: "T1562.003 - Firewall Modification Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1562.003"
technique_name: "Firewall Modification"
description: >
  Detect attempts to modify firewall rules to allow unauthorized network traffic or block security monitoring.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Firewall Rule Changes"
    description: >
      Detect changes to firewall configurations, including addition, deletion, or modification of rules.
    checklist:
      - "Are firewall rules added or removed unexpectedly?"
      - "Are changes made by unusual users or processes?"
    data_sources:
      - "Firewall logs"
      - "System event logs"
      - "Configuration management logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Correlate with Suspicious Network Activity"
    description: >
      Check if firewall changes correlate with suspicious inbound or outbound connections.
    checklist:
      - "Is there new or unauthorized traffic allowed post change?"
      - "Are blocked alerts or network anomalies detected?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network flow logs"
      - "Intrusion detection system (IDS) alerts"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Validate Legitimate Change Requests"
    description: >
      Confirm whether firewall changes were authorized as part of maintenance.
    checklist:
      - "Was the change approved by network/security team?"
      - "Is there a documented maintenance window?"
    data_sources:
      - "Change management system"
      - "Helpdesk tickets"

  - step_number: 4
    title: "Contain and Respond"
    description: >
      If unauthorized, block changes and initiate incident response.
    checklist:
      - "Isolate affected hosts if required."
      - "Revert firewall to known good state."
    data_sources:
      - "Incident response tools"
      - "Firewall management consoles"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized maintenance changes."
      - "Medium: Unexpected changes without clear cause."
      - "High: Unauthorized changes linked to attacker activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Matches known attacker behavior."
      - "Medium: Unexplained changes needing review."
      - "Low: Benign or scheduled changes."

ioc_types:
  - "Firewall rule changes"
  - "Configuration file modifications"
  - "Suspicious process modifying firewall"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Windows Firewall Rule Change Event"
    query: >
      EventID:4946 OR EventID:4947 OR EventID:4948
  - name: "Linux Firewall Rule Change via iptables"
    query: >

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on firewall rule modifications outside business hours."
  - "Auto-tag related network anomalies."
  - "Trigger IR workflow for unauthorized changes."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review user/process initiating firewall changes."
  - "Check timing and correlation with other suspicious activity."
  - "Confirm with network/security teams."
