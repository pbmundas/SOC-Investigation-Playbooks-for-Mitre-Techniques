playbook_name: "T1560.003 - Archive via Compression Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1560.003"
technique_name: "Archive via Compression"
description: >
  Detects adversaries using compression algorithms (gzip, bzip2, 7zip) to reduce size of collected data before exfiltration.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Execution of Compression Utilities"
    description: >
      Identify execution of compression tools like gzip, bzip2, 7zip, and related commands.
    checklist:
      - "Are compression utilities run by non-standard users or processes?"
      - "Is compression activity correlated with access to sensitive data?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command line monitoring"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Creation of Compressed Files"
    description: >
      Look for files created with extensions such as .gz, .bz2, .7z, .xz, .lzma.
    checklist:
      - "Are compressed files created in unusual directories or by suspicious processes?"
      - "Is file creation followed by network transfers?"
    data_sources:
      - "File system monitoring"
      - "Process monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Compression with Network Exfiltration"
    description: >
      Investigate if compressed files are moved or transmitted externally shortly after creation.
    checklist:
      - "Is outbound traffic detected shortly after compression?"
      - "Are destination IPs or domains suspicious or unknown?"
    data_sources:
      - "Network logs"
      - "SIEM correlation"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Compression for routine backups or maintenance."
      - "Medium: Suspicious compression without confirmed exfiltration."
      - "High: Compression activity linked to data theft."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Verified compression followed by data exfiltration."
      - "Medium: Suspicious compression behavior."
      - "Low: Normal compression usage."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of gzip, bzip2, 7zip, xz utilities"
  - "Creation of compressed files (.gz, .bz2, .7z)"
  - "Outbound network activity after compression"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect Compression Utility Execution"
    query: >
      process.name IN ("gzip", "bzip2", "7z", "xz") AND
      user.name NOT IN ("backup", "admin")

  - name: "Compressed File Creation"
    query: >
      file.extension IN (".gz", ".bz2", ".7z", ".xz") AND
      process.parent.name IN ("gzip", "bzip2", "7z", "xz")

  - "Alert on compression utility execution by unauthorized users."
  - "Block suspicious compressed file transfers."
  - "Notify security operations team."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Verify if compression is part of legitimate workflows."
  - "Analyze user and process context for anomalies."
  - "Check network destinations for potential exfiltration."
