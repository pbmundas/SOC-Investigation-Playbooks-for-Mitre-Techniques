playbook_name: "T1119 - Automated Collection via Lambda or EC2 Scripts"
tactic: "Collection"
technique_id: "T1119"
technique_name: "Automated Collection"
description: >
  Detect and investigate use of automated scripts or functions running on AWS Lambda
  or EC2 instances that collect data for malicious purposes, including information
  gathering or exfiltration preparation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Lambda Function Executions"
    description: >
      Track Lambda invocations and changes to function code or configurations
      that may indicate unauthorized data collection.
    checklist:
      - "Are new or modified Lambda functions executing data collection tasks?"
      - "Is function execution volume or timing unusual?"
      - "Are environment variables or IAM roles attached to Lambda overly permissive?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "AWS Lambda Logs (CloudWatch)"
      - "AWS Config"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Monitor EC2 Script Execution"
    description: >
      Review execution of scripts on EC2 instances, particularly those accessing
      sensitive data or communicating externally.
    checklist:
      - "Are there scheduled or triggered scripts accessing data repositories?"
      - "Is there evidence of script execution outside normal maintenance windows?"
      - "Are EC2 IAM roles or instance profiles configured with excessive permissions?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "EC2 System Logs"
      - "CloudWatch Logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Detect Data Collection Behavior"
    description: >
      Identify patterns consistent with data aggregation or staging prior to exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Is data from multiple sources aggregated in temporary storage?"
      - "Are scripts or functions accessing multiple AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, RDS)?"
      - "Is there suspicious network activity from EC2 or Lambda to external endpoints?"
    data_sources:
      - "VPC Flow Logs"
      - "CloudTrail Logs"
      - "CloudWatch Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized automated data collection for business needs."
      - "Medium: Unusual or unapproved data collection detected."
      - "High: Confirmed malicious data collection or exfiltration."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear evidence of unauthorized data gathering."
      - "Medium: Suspicious automation without full confirmation."
      - "Low: Routine automation with minor deviations."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of Lambda functions with data access"
  - "Scripts on EC2 accessing sensitive data stores"
  - "Unusual network connections from automated functions"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Lambda Function Data Access"
    query: >

  - name: "EC2 Script Execution Outside Schedule"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on new or modified Lambda functions accessing data."
  - "Trigger EDR snapshot on EC2 instances running suspicious scripts."
  - "Throttle suspicious outbound network traffic pending review."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate the purpose and authorization of automated data collection."
  - "Review function and script code for malicious intent."
  - "Correlate automated collection with downstream exfiltration attempts."
