playbook_name: "T1057 - Process Discovery Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Discovery"
technique_id: "T1057"
technique_name: "Process Discovery"
description: >
  Detects adversaries enumerating running processes on a system to gather information on active applications and services for further exploitation or lateral movement.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Process Enumeration Commands and API Calls"
    description: >
      Identify use of tools or commands such as `tasklist`, `ps`, `Get-Process`, or API calls like `EnumProcesses` used to list running processes.
    checklist:
      - "Are process enumeration commands or scripts executed?"
      - "Are these actions performed by unusual or unauthorized users?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command-line auditing"
      - "API monitoring logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Anomalous or Automated Process Enumeration"
    description: >
      Look for repeated or high-frequency process discovery, which may indicate automated reconnaissance or scanning.
    checklist:
      - "Is process enumeration occurring frequently or at odd times?"
      - "Are non-admin users performing process discovery?"
    data_sources:
      - "User activity logs"
      - "Endpoint monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate Process Discovery with Other Malicious Activity"
    description: >
      Determine if process discovery is followed by lateral movement, privilege escalation, or malicious payload execution.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of suspicious process creation after discovery?"
      - "Are there related alerts or suspicious network connections?"
    data_sources:
      - "Endpoint detection logs"
      - "Network logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Process discovery by legitimate admin users."
      - "Medium: Discovery by standard users or during unusual times."
      - "High: Discovery preceding malicious activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Confirmed unauthorized process enumeration."
      - "Medium: Suspicious process discovery activity."
      - "Low: Routine system monitoring."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of `tasklist`, `ps`, or PowerShell `Get-Process`"
  - "API calls to enumerate processes"
  - "Process enumeration by suspicious user context"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect PowerShell Get-Process Usage"
    query: >
      process.name == "powershell.exe" AND
      process.command_line MATCHES "(?i)Get-Process"

  - name: "Detect tasklist Command"
    query: >
      process.name == "tasklist.exe"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on process enumeration by unauthorized users."
  - "Throttle or block suspicious process enumeration commands."
  - "Investigate user context and subsequent activities."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Determine if process discovery is authorized."
  - "Correlate with signs of compromise or lateral movement."
  - "Recommend restricting access to process enumeration tools."
