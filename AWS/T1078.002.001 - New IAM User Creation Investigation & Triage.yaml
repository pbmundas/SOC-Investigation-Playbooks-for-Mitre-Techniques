playbook_name: "T1078.002.001 - New IAM User Creation: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Persistence"
technique_id: "T1078.002"
technique_name: "New IAM User Creation"
description: >
  Detect creation of new IAM users which may be leveraged by attackers to gain or maintain access to AWS environments.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify New IAM User Creation"
    description: >
      Monitor AWS CloudTrail for CreateUser API calls.
    checklist:
      - "Is the new user created by an authorized administrator?"
      - "Is creation time within a known maintenance or change window?"
      - "Does the username follow organizational conventions?"
    data_sources:
      - "AWS CloudTrail (CreateUser)"
      - "AWS Config IAM resource history"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Review New User Permissions"
    description: >
      Analyze attached permissions to ensure no excessive privilege is granted.
    checklist:
      - "Are permissions aligned with the principle of least privilege?"
      - "Are administrator policies attached?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail (PutUserPolicy, AttachUserPolicy)"
      - "IAM Access Advisor"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Detect Usage of New IAM Users"
    description: >
      Check for console logins or API usage by new users.
    checklist:
      - "Are new users logging in or calling APIs soon after creation?"
      - "Is access occurring from expected IPs or geographies?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail (ConsoleLogin, API calls)"
      - "CloudWatch Logs"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Authorized new user creation."
      - "Medium: Unusual creation with no immediate suspicious use."
      - "High: Unauthorized user creation with suspicious activity."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Clear evidence of unauthorized creation and usage."
      - "Medium: Anomalous creation requiring review."
      - "Low: False positive due to automated provisioning."

ioc_types:
  - "CreateUser API events"
  - "New IAM users with administrator or broad permissions"
  - "Console login or API calls from new users"
