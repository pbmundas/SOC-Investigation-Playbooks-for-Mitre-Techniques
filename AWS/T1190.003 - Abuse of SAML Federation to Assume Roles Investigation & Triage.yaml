playbook_name: "T1190.003 - Abuse of SAML Federation to Assume Roles: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Credential Access"
technique_id: "T1190.003"
technique_name: "Abuse of SAML Federation to Assume Roles"
description: >
  Detect unauthorized or suspicious use of SAML federation to assume AWS IAM roles, potentially indicating credential compromise or privilege escalation.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor AssumeRoleWithSAML API Calls"
    description: >
      Track AssumeRoleWithSAML calls indicating SAML federation usage.
    checklist:
      - "Are there AssumeRoleWithSAML API calls from unusual users or IP addresses?"
      - "Is the frequency of SAML federation logins abnormally high?"
      - "Are roles assumed different from the user's normal permissions?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail logs (AssumeRoleWithSAML)"
      - "Identity provider logs"
      - "IAM logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Analyze Federation and Role Usage Patterns"
    description: >
      Identify anomalies in SAML assertion usage or role assumptions.
    checklist:
      - "Are there multiple or rapid role assumptions by the same user?"
      - "Is there use of roles with excessive privileges?"
      - "Are federated sessions longer than normal or spanning unusual times?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "IdP (Identity Provider) logs"
      - "Session duration metadata"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Other Suspicious Activities"
    description: >
      Look for related IAM changes, resource modifications, or exfiltration.
    checklist:
      - "Are there new IAM policies or roles created after federation?"
      - "Is there evidence of lateral movement or data access?"
      - "Are logs or monitoring systems tampered with?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "IAM logs"
      - "Network monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Normal SAML federation usage."
      - "Medium: Unusual SAML federation patterns."
      - "High: Confirmed abuse or compromise via SAML federation."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Federation from suspicious IPs or linked to breach."
      - "Medium: Anomalous role assumption frequency or permissions."
      - "Low: Possible false positives due to legitimate changes."

ioc_types:
  - "AssumeRoleWithSAML API calls from untrusted sources"
  - "Rapid or multiple role assumptions"
  - "Federated sessions with unusual privileges or durations"

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious SAML federation usage."
  - "Revoke or disable federated sessions if compromise suspected."
  - "Trigger investigation and access reviews."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate federated users and roles with IAM and IdP teams."
  - "Audit federation configuration and permissions."
  - "Contain compromised sessions and review related accounts."
