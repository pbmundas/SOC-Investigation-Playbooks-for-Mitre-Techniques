playbook_name: "T1681 - UAC Bypass Detection: Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Defense Evasion"
technique_id: "T1681"
technique_name: "Bypass User Account Control"
description: >
  Detects attempts to bypass User Account Control (UAC) to escalate privileges without prompting for consent.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Identify Known UAC Bypass Techniques"
    description: >
      Monitor for suspicious execution of known UAC bypass methods such as eventvwr.exe, fodhelper.exe, or silent cleanup.
    checklist:
      - "Are processes like eventvwr.exe or fodhelper.exe launched unexpectedly?"
      - "Is there a parent-child process chain consistent with UAC bypass?"
    data_sources:
      - "Process creation logs"
      - "Command line auditing"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Detect Execution of Malicious Scripts or Payloads"
    description: >
      Look for script executions or payloads triggered via elevated COM interfaces or registry hijacks.
    checklist:
      - "Are there registry modifications under HKCU\Software\Classes\...\shell\open\command?"
      - "Are elevated COM objects being invoked unexpectedly?"
    data_sources:
      - "Registry monitoring"
      - "Script execution logs"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate with Privilege Escalation and Anomalous Behavior"
    description: >
      Confirm if UAC bypass attempts result in elevated privileges or suspicious activity.
    checklist:
      - "Is there evidence of privilege escalation post bypass?"
      - "Are there abnormal administrative actions performed?"
    data_sources:
      - "Security event logs"
      - "User activity monitoring"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Single process execution without follow-up suspicious activity."
      - "Medium: Multiple UAC bypass attempts detected."
      - "High: Confirmed privilege escalation via UAC bypass."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known UAC bypass technique detected and confirmed."
      - "Medium: Suspicious process chains indicative of bypass."
      - "Low: Potential benign use of these utilities."

ioc_types:
  - "Execution of eventvwr.exe, fodhelper.exe with suspicious parameters"
  - "Registry keys hijacked for UAC bypass"
  - "Elevated COM object usage outside normal behavior"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect UAC Bypass via fodhelper.exe"
    query: >
      process.name == "fodhelper.exe" AND
      parent_process.name NOT IN ("explorer.exe", "trusted_uac_launcher.exe")

  - name: "Detect Registry Hijack for UAC Bypass"
    query: >
      registry.path CONTAINS "HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command" AND
      registry.value MATCHES ("powershell|cmd.exe")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on UAC bypass attempts."
  - "Block or quarantine involved processes."
  - "Initiate privilege review and password resets if needed."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Review process trees for suspicious parent-child chains."
  - "Validate if UAC prompts were suppressed or bypassed."
  - "Recommend patching and restricting known UAC bypass vectors."
