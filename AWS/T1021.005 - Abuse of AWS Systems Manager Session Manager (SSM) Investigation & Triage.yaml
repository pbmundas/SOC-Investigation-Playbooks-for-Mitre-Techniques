playbook_name: "T1021.005 - Abuse of AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (SSM): Investigation & Triage"
tactic: "Lateral Movement"
technique_id: "T1021.005"
technique_name: "AWS Systems Manager Session Manager Abuse"
description: >
  Detect misuse of AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to gain interactive shell access or execute commands on managed instances, which may indicate lateral movement or persistence.

investigation_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    title: "Monitor Session Manager API Calls and Session Activity"
    description: >
      Track StartSession, SendCommand, and other SSM-related API calls.
    checklist:
      - "Are there unexpected or excessive StartSession or SendCommand API calls?"
      - "Are sessions initiated by unusual users, roles, or from unusual IPs?"
      - "Is there evidence of command execution inconsistent with normal operations?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail (StartSession, SendCommand)"
      - "SSM Session logs"
      - "IAM and access logs"

  - step_number: 2
    title: "Identify Command Execution Patterns and Persistence Attempts"
    description: >
      Analyze commands run via SSM to detect potential malicious activity or persistence techniques.
    checklist:
      - "Are commands creating new users, installing backdoors, or disabling monitoring?"
      - "Is there evidence of lateral movement or data exfiltration?"
      - "Are there attempts to escalate privileges?"
    data_sources:
      - "SSM command logs"
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "Endpoint monitoring"

  - step_number: 3
    title: "Correlate SSM Activity with Other Indicators"
    description: >
      Cross-check with IAM changes, network anomalies, or alerts from threat intel.
    checklist:
      - "Are new IAM roles/users created or modified around SSM abuse?"
      - "Is there evidence of suspicious network connections or data transfers?"
      - "Are monitoring/logging tools being disabled?"
    data_sources:
      - "CloudTrail"
      - "Network logs"
      - "SIEM"

triage_labels:
  - severity_levels:
      - "Low: Routine use of SSM by authorized admins."
      - "Medium: Suspicious command execution or session initiation."
      - "High: Confirmed abuse for lateral movement or persistence."
  - confidence_levels:
      - "High: Known malicious commands or IPs."
      - "Medium: Anomalous session patterns."
      - "Low: Possible false positives due to legitimate automation."

ioc_types:
  - "StartSession or SendCommand API calls from suspicious users or IPs"
  - "Malicious commands executed via SSM"
  - "Unusual session durations or frequencies"

queries/examples:
  - name: "Detect StartSession from Unusual IPs"
    query: >
      eventName="StartSession" AND sourceIPAddress NOT IN (trusted_IPs)
  - name: "Detect Suspicious Commands via SendCommand"
    query: >
      eventName="SendCommand" AND commandString IN ("net user", "powershell -EncodedCommand", "curl", "wget")

automation_hooks:
  - "Alert on suspicious SSM session starts or commands."
  - "Terminate suspicious SSM sessions immediately."
  - "Trigger incident response for potential lateral movement."

analyst_guidance:
  - "Validate if sessions align with authorized maintenance."
  - "Investigate commands for potential compromise."
  - "Contain affected hosts and review IAM permissions."
